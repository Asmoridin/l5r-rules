         <h1>1: INTRODUCTION</h1>
         <p>Welcome to the combined Legend of the Five Rings (L5R) rulebook!  The goal of this page is to allow anyone to have what they need to play the L5R card game, regardless of edition they wish to play.</p>
         <p>In the Legend of the Five Rings (from here on: L5R) card game, you'll build a customized deck representing one of the various factions fighting for control and the future of Rokugan. You will conduct battles, duel, use politics, and subterfuge, and attempt to win the game with one of the game's many victory conditions.</p>
         <p>The L5R CCG first came out in 1995, published by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG). It lasted until AEG's sale of the L5R IP to Fantasy Flight Games (FFG) in 2015. FFG released a Living Card Game (LCG) for L5R, but we do not cover it here.</p>
         <h2>About this rulebook</h2>
         <p>The goal of this rulebook is to try to put, in one place, all of the rules, rulings, and anything needed to allow people to play L5R in whatever format they'd like. Included will be rules for Arc, Modern, Big-Deck... basically any way to play the game where information can be found. I am using the Comprehensive Rules for Twenty Festivals as the baseline document for this rulebook, and changing it to fit my needs.</p>
         <p>A couple of things to keep in mind:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Cards vs. rules: If the text of any card contradicts these Comprehensive Rules, follow the card text, not the rules. Something that changes one aspect of a rule does not by itself change any other aspects of the rule. Example: An effect that lets you make a Ranged Attack against a card in a player's home only changes the rule that the target of a Ranged Attack must be in the current enemy army; it does not change the rule that the target of a Ranged Attack must be a Follower or a Personality without Followers.</li>
            <li>Cards vs. cards: New versions of cards with a given identity (title and experience level) may sometimes be printed. If different printings contradict each other, follow the most recent Ivory-legal printing of the card, or the most recent printing if the card was never Ivory-legal.</li>
         </ul>
         <h1>2: THE CARDS</h1>
         <p>There are fourteen card types in L5R, but not all card types exist in all arcs. Your cards also go into one of three areas - Pre-Game cards (which start the game in play), Dynasty cards (which start the game in your Dynasty Deck), and Fate cards (which start the game in your Fate Deck).</p>
         <h2>Pre-Game Cards</h2>
         <h3>Stronghold</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <p>The choice of Stronghold is part of deck construction. An object incorporating a legal Stronghold card can be used if it shows all stats, text and symbols of the original card.</p>
         <p>Historically, Stronholds were one-sided, but starting in Ivory Edition, Stronghold cards were changed to two-sided, with the side used at the start of the game determined by whether you were going first or second.</p>
         <p>If you are going first, with a two-sided Stronghold, the "going first" side should be face up (one clan mon, black border). Otherwise, you use the other side (two clan mons, white border).
         <p>Clan Mon: Next to a Stronghold's title is an insignia, or mon, that shows what Clan Alignment the player is. If there is no mon, the Stronghold is Unaligned.</p>
         <p>Province Strength: The topmost of three icons at the right of the Stronghold shows the starting strength of each of the player's Provinces. This number will be the amount of Force an attacking army will need to exceed a defending army by in order to destroy a province. Strength may go upand down separately for each Province during the game.</p>
         <p>Gold Production: The middle of a Stronghold's three icons, the coin, shows its Gold Production (abbreviated GP); the amount of Gold the Stronghold produces when bowed. A Stronghold's GP is a stat that can be affected by tokens and effects.</p>
         <p>Staring Family Honor: The bottom icon on a Stronghold shows its Starting Family Honor stat, which gives a starting value for the player's Family Honor score.</p>
         <p>Stronghold Immunity: Effects and costs will not make a Stronghold leave play unless they specifically mention Strongholds.</p>
         <h3>Sensei</h3>
         <h3>Wind</h3>
         <h2>Dynasty Cards</h2>
         <h3>Celestial</h3>
         <h3>Event</h3>
         <h3>Holding</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <p>Holding cards represent a player's resources. They often can be bowed to produce Gold, but frequently have other effects as well.</p>
         <p>Holdings, like many cards, have a Gold Cost - the number in the central round yellow coin icon - which determines how much must be paid to bring the card into play.</p>
         <p>Holdings use the Recruit action or procedure to enter play, and enter play in the bowed state (that is, already bowed, without bowing).</p>
         <p>Some Holdings have the Forftification keyword. These follow special rules that will be covered later</p>
         <p>Many Holding have a Gold Production stat. A Holding's Gold Production (GP) is an optional stat found in the yellow coin icon at top right. It is the amount of Gold produced when the Holding is bowed for Gold production. Gold-producing Holdings are those that have this stat; non-Gold-producing Holdings do not have the icon or the stat, so their Gold Production cannot be raised. Gold Production can be changed by card effects and tokens.</p>
         <h3>Personality</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h3>Region</h3>
         <h2>Fate Cards</h2>
         <h3>Ancestor</h3>
         <h3>Follower</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h3>Item</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h3>Ring</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h3>Spell</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h3>Strategy</h3>
         <p>Present in all arcs</p>
         <h1>3: BUILDING A DECK</h1>
         <p>An L5R game deck consists of both a Fate Deck, a Dynasty Deck, and one or more pre-game cards.</p>
         <h1>4: GETTING SET UP</h1>
         <p>Each player has two decks: black-backed Dynasty cards and green-backed Fate cards, plus a special Stronghold card with two sides, one for going first (black border) and one for going second (white border). Which side is used depends on whether you go first or second, which we'll determine soon. For now, put either side face up.</p>
         <p>To get ready to play, find your Stronghold card and place it in front of you. The examples in this Rulebook will take the perspective of a Crab Clan player, but you can try to reach the same goals using your Clan deck.</p>
         <p>Next, separate the rest of your cards into Dynasty and Fate cards. Turn the decks face up and look at the Dynasty cards first. For the basic game, we'll be playing with only two kinds of Dynasty cards: Personalities (with your Clan insignia, or mon, in the upper left-hand side) and Holdings (with a three-circles insignia in the same place). If you're using an Ivory Edition starter deck, you may find other card types in there; remove them until you're ready to move on to the Advanced Rules.</p>
         <p>Do the same with your Fate deck, keeping only Strategies (red background), Followers (tan background), and Items (dark blue background). If you have a Dragon Clan deck, your Stronghold lets you start with one Ring in play; take it out of the deck and put it beside your Stronghold.</p>
         <p>Place your Dynasty deck below your Stronghold, about where your left hand is. Take the top four cards of your Dynasty deck and, without looking at them or turning them over, deal them out to the right of the deck. These four cards represent your Provinces—areas that hold Dynasty cards.</p>
         <p>Your Fate deck goes to the right of the fourth Province. The Fate deck provides cards that you draw into your hand of cards, representing secret resources and strategies. In your first couple of turns you won't need to use your Fate deck or cards. Just draw 5 Fate cards, facedown, and set them aside for now.</p>
         <p>Your opponent should take the same steps, setting up facing you on the table.</p>
         <h1>5: PLAYING THE GAME</h1>
         <p>The game takes place over a number of turns. One player takes their turn, going through the phases, and then play passes to the other player. In most cases, play during a phase involves the alternating opportunity for actions from each player, with a phase ending upon both players passing.</p>
         <p>The phases of a game turn are:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Action Phase</li>
            <li>Attack Phase</li>
            <li>Dynasty Phase</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Once a player has completed their Dynasty Phase, the next player starts their turn with the Action Phase</p>
         <h1>6: WINNING THE GAME</h1>
      </div>
      <p>
         CHANGES FROM IVORY EDITION #
         2. A new wording speciÒes when Gold production can only be used for a single
         purpose.
         3. Equip and Recruit now target the card they are bringing into play.
         4. In the action sequence there is a "choose targets" step after costs are paid and
         before Interrupts are taken, although actual targeting that triggers effects is still
         taken in action resolution, normally based on the earlier choices.
         5. FortiÒcations enter play bowed by default.
         6. Shugenja is no longer a boldface keyword; the rules that Spells can only attach
         to them are now more clearly a rule about Spells, not Shugenja.
         7. Addition of the Unstoppable and Legacy keywords.
         THE PLAYER #
         CLAN ALIGNMENT #
         A player's Clan Alignment derives from his or her Stronghold's Clan Alignment.
         Effects that say "You are an [X] Clan player" give the player that Clan Alignment.
         A player using a Stronghold with no Clan Alignment has no Clan Alignment, and is
         unaligned. An unaligned player does not have the same Clan Alignment as
         unaligned Personalities.
         Legal Clan Alignments in Twenty Festivals are:
         0.1. Crab Clan
         0.2. Crane Clan
         0.3. Dragon Clan
         0.4. Lion Clan
         0.5. Mantis Clan
         0.6. Phoenix Clan
         0.7. Scorpion Clan
         0.8. Spider Clan
         0.9. Unicorn Clan
         Other Clan Alignments given by effects only exist in games where those effects
         apply.
         For "control a Clan Alignment" see Control.
         FAMILY HONOR
         A player's Family Honor, or Honor for short, is a number that represents the
         respect and integrity he or she is seen to have in the Imperial Court. It may rise
         and fall over the course of the game. A player is responsible for keeping an
         accurate record of his or her Family Honor that other players can check. Players
         may also conÒrm their opponents' Family Honor by keeping their own record.
         A player's starting Family Honor is taken from his or her Stronghold's Starting
         Family Honor stat.
         Family Honor is a numerical value, but follows different rules than card stats..
         Family Honor may have a negative value. Also, because Family Honor is marked
         in the game, changes to it do not have a duration; they are instantaneous.
         HONOR GAINS AND LOSSES #
         If an Honor gain or loss is reduced or increased by another effect, the reduction
         or increase is not itself an Honor gain or loss.
         Reduction of an Honor gain cannot turn it into a loss, nor can reduction of a loss
         turn it into a gain; the minimum value of a gain or loss is zero. Losses are
         expressed in positive numbers even though their ultimate effect is to reduce
         Honor.
         An Honor gain of 0 points is not considered an Honor gain for things that check
         whether a gain happened. Likewise, an Honor loss of 0 points is not considered
         an Honor loss for such purposes. Reduction of an Honor gain or loss to 0 points
         may effectively prevent it. See Timing. Each separate Honor loss or gain happens
         all at once.
         POINTS OF FAMILY HONOR #
         References to "points of Family Honor" assume a positive Family Honor value.
         Example: A Ranged 3 Attack that gains "+1 strength for every 10 points of Family
         Honor you have," does not gain any strength when the player is at -10 Family Honor.
         MAXIMUM HAND SIZE #
         A player starts with a maximum hand size of 8, referring to the number of cards
         he or she is allowed to keep in hand at the end of the turn. A player with no
         maximum hand size has an effectively inÒnite maximum hand size.
         Maximum hand size is a stat of the player and follows the rules about stats.
         PLAYER ABILITIES AND TRAITS #
         Players may gain abilities and traits from effects, and start the game with a
         number of abilities. The following is a list of default player abilities from the
         rulebook:
         Limited
         0.1. Cycle
         0.2. Lobby
         0.3. Rulebook Favor Limited
         0.4. Kharmic
         Open
         0.1. Equip
         Engage
         0.1. Naval Invasion
         0.2. Cavalry
         Interrupt
         0.1. Courage
         Battle
         0.1. Rulebook Favor Battle
         0.2. Reserve
         Dynasty
         0.1. Recruit
         0.2. Dynasty Discard
         0.3. Legacy
         Player abilities, like abilities on cards, may only be taken once per turn per player
         by default. Each player has a separate "copy" of all his or her player abilities.
         PLAYERS WINNING AND LOSING #
         L5R has a number of different victory conditions that reÓect different paths to
         mastering the world of Rokugan or eliminating other players from contention.
         MILITARY LOSS/VICTORY #
         A player loses immediately when he or she has no Provinces remaining.
         When two players are in a game (including the later stages of a game that started
         with more players), and one player loses this way, the last remaining player has
         won a Military Victory.
         DISHONOR LOSS/VICTORY #
         If a player's Family Honor is -20 or below at the end of his or her turn, he or she
         loses. When two or more players are in a game and a player loses in this way, if
         there is only one remaining player, he or she has won a Dishonor Victory.
         HONOR VICTORY #
         A player wins by starting his or her turn on 40 Family Honor or higher. This is an
         Honor victory.
         ENLIGHTENMENT VICTORY #
         A player wins immediately by controlling Òve Rings with Òve different element
         keywords (Air, Earth, Fire, Water and Void). "Enlighten" means to win by
         Enlightenment.
         SPECIAL VICTORY CONDITIONS #
         Cards in the game may give other conditions of winning or losing. Winning by one
         of these cards, or because one of them caused the last remaining other player to
         lose, is designated by the title of that card.
         Example: The card Political Standoff has the trait, "A player who begins his turn with
         50 or more InÓuence tokens wins the game." Winning this way is known as a Political
         Standoff victory.
         PLAYER ELIMINATION #
         The following rules apply to multiplayer games.
         If a player loses the game and two or more players remain, all cards from the
         eliminated player's play deck are removed from the game (regardless of who
         controls them), all created cards under his control are removed from the game,
         all his remaining Provinces leave the game (without literally being destroyed), and
         he leaves the game. An eliminated player's tokens that are still in play after this,
         as well as his created cards that are controlled by other players, remain in play.
         If an attacker is eliminated in the middle of a series of battles, the player to his
         left determines the order remaining battles will resolve in.
         Effects generated by eliminated players' cards or actions persist for their normal
         duration. For effects that will end during some future turn of the eliminated
         player, end them after the previous remaining player's turn and before the next
         remaining player's turn.
         TURN ORDER #
         Turn order proceeds to the left. If no order or starting player is speciÒed for a
         sequence of occurrences affecting different players, they are carried out in turn
         order, starting with the active player.
         If an effect alters which player goes Òrst in an action round (for example, taking
         Battle actions in a battle), turn order proceeds leftwards from him or her.
         THE PLAY DECK #
         The "play deck" is the set of cards chosen by the player with which to play the
         game. It actually consists of two decks - one of black-backed Dynasty cards, one
         of green-backed Fate cards - one Stronghold card, and optionally one Sensei
         card. These cards are chosen according to a format.
         DECK CONSTRUCTION RULES #
         L5R has a standard competitive format and a number of alternate formats.
         Standard formats are referred to with a term such as Extended or Arc, referring
         to the card sets that are legal to play, and by default are 40/40 (the minimum
         number of cards in the Dynasty and Fate decks, respectively), .
         SpeciÒc format construction rules can be found in the most recent Floor Rules
         (pdf download), section 4. The following rules apply to all formats, unless the
         format speciÒcally overrides them:
         0.1. Only one copy of each Unique card, by card title, may be included
         in the play deck.
         0.2. No more than three copies of any non-Unique card, by card title,
         may be included in a play deck.EXCEPTION: Cards with the same title
         but different Experienced levels (including non-experienced versions)
         count as different copies for deck construction.
         Rules for formats other than standard are listed under the Alternate Format
         Rules section.
         CARD TYPES #
         STARTING CARD TYPES #
         
         SENSEI #
         A Sensei is a starting card with modiÒers for Province Strength, Gold Production
         and Starting Family Honor which are continually applied to the Stronghold's stats.
         A Sensei may also have traits and abilities. The Sensei does not go into the
         Dynasty or Fate deck and is neither a Dynasty nor Fate card.
         A play deck may only have one Sensei, and it starts in play (if included). The
         choice of Sensei is part of deck construction; for example, it may not be changed,
         added, or removed between rounds in a tournament.
         (Unlike previous rules sets, modiÒers from a Sensei are treated like any other
         modiÒer; they do not modify the printed values on the Stronghold. Also, unlike
         previous rules sets, these traits and abilities are not considered to be on the
         Stronghold; Sensei cards bow and have abilities separately from the Stronghold.)
         A Sensei may have clan restrictions, expressed either with the full Clan name or
         with a short form ("Dragon" for "Dragon Clan"). A player may only start with a
         Sensei that is "All Clans" or has his or her Stronghold's Clan in the restriction list.
         These restrictions appear in the normal keyword area but are not keywords; a
         "Dragon" Sensei is not a "Dragon," for example.
         DYNASTY CARD TYPES #
         PERSONALITY #
         Clan Mon: Like a Stronghold, the title bar of a Personality will have a mon
         indicating his Clan Alignment, or no mon if Unaligned. Earlier Ivory Edition legal
         cards indicate Personality Clan Alignment with both the mon and a keyword; later
         cards indicate Clan Alignment only with the mon, but are also considered to have
         the keyword.
         Personalities enter play using the Recruit action or procedure.
         FORCE (PERSONALITY) #
         A Personality's Force, abbreviated as "F," is found in the lighter colored icon at the
         top left.
         CHI #
         Chi, abbreviated "C", is found in the dark colored icon at top right.
         HONOR REQUIREMENT #
         Personalities may have an Honor Requirement, abbreviated "HR," shown in the
         leftmost of the three icons in the middle (the square banner). A dash (-) in this
         icon means that the Personality has an inÒnitely low Honor Requirement, with no
         numeric value except that it is always lower than any numeric HR. Honor
         Requirement may be lower than zero.
         A player cannot bring a Personality into play with Honor Requirement higher
         than his or her current Family Honor.
         If anything but a player's own cards causes him or her to lose Honor (that is,
         other players' cards and rulebook Honor losses, such as dying dishonorably),
         then for the rest of the game, that player ignore Honor Requirements when
         bringing Personalities with his or her Clan Alignment into play.
         GOLD COST (PERSONALITY) #
         Personalities have a Gold Cost, the number in a round yellow coin shape, which
         must be paid to Recruit them. The player pays an additional cost to recruit
         Personalities with a Clan Alignment; see Recruit.
         PERSONAL HONOR #
         Personal Honor is found in the fan, the rightmost of the three icons. Its
         abbreviation is "PH."
         Unit: A Personality and attached cards make up a unit.
         CHI DEATH RULE #
         If a Personality's Chi is ever zero, destroy him immediately. Effects that prevent a
         single instance of destruction will not prevent this; only continuous effects work
         against Chi death (for example, "This Personality will not be destroyed.")
         EVENT #
         Events, with white and gray scroll frames, represent important happenings in
         Rokugan. While they are face-up in their player's Provinces, their abilities can be
         used. If they enter play, their traits are active while in play, but their abilities
         cannot be used unless otherwise stated. Events in Provinces are discarded once
         an ability on them is used, unless the ability puts the Event itself into play.
         FATE CARDS #
         FOCUS VALUE #
         All Fate cards have a Focus Value stat, in the black circle at the bottom of the
         card.
         STRATEGY #
         Strategy cards are cards normally played from the hand to use an ability on
         them. When played from any area, they go to an entering-play area while Good
         Faith is checked, costs are paid, and effects resolve. Once the action has Ònished
         resolving, the player discards the Strategy, unless the Strategy put itself into play.
         A Strategy usually has one or more abilities. Traits on a Strategy always modify its
         own abilities, and may affect play more generally if the Strategy enters play. If a
         Strategy enters play, its abilities may be used as normal.
         RING #
         A player may put a Ring into play from his or her hand immediately after he or
         she has fulÒlled its condition for entering play. This may not be delayed.
         However, a condition may be fulÒlled more than once by new occurrences; for
         example, if a player takes a third Favor action after having already taken two, he
         or she can play the Ring of Air after the third.
         A Ring's text may also let a player discard it from his or her hand for an effect, as
         stated on each Ring. Normally, this effect is to use the Ring's ability without cost;
         in this case, the Ring enters a resolution area while the relevant ability is
         resolving, and is discarded afterwards.
         ATTACHMENTS #
         Followers, Items and Spells are all attachment cards. They normally attach to
         Personalities in play using the Equip procedure, placing the card under the
         Personality with the title showing. Attaching a card requires choosing or targeting
         a Personality to attach to. Attachments may only enter play by being attached to
         a Personality, are discarded if in play and not attached to a Personality, and they
         are the only card type that may attach to a Personality.
         A player may only attach attachments to a Personality he or she controls.
         Gold Cost: Attachments have a Gold Cost stat which equals the amount a player
         must pay when Equipping them.
         FOLLOWER #
         Followers have a yellow-brown background.
         They have Force, in the icon at the top left, which helps their unit in battle. A
         Follower's Force is independent and does not contribute in battle resolution if the
         Follower is bowed (regardless of the Personality being bowed or not).
         ITEM #
         Items have a dark blue background and sword frame at the bottom of their
         artwork. Unlike the separate Force of Followers,
         FORCE MODIFIER #
         Items have a Force modiÒer in the upper left hand icon that directly raises or
         lowers their Personality's Force.
         CHI MODIFIER #
         Items likewise have a Chi modiÒer. These modiÒers are not bonuses, but affect
         their stat in the same way as bonuses do, including being subject to maximum
         and minimum values (see Stats.
         If something in the game needs to check an Item's Force or Chi separately from
         its Personality's stats, use the value of its modiÒer (minimum zero).
         Force and Chi bonuses or penalties to an Item affect the modiÒer; for example, a
         +1F Item that suffers -2F now has a -1F modiÒer.
         SPELL #
         Spells, with a light blue background, have no Force or Chi stats or modiÒers. They
         will only attach to a Shugenja Personality, and their abilities can only be used
         ("cast") if attached to a Shugenja.
         CARD FEATURES #
         CARD TITLE #
         At the top of every card is its title bar. All L5R cards have a title in this bar, except
         for created cards, which have no title.
         The text at the top of proxy created cards printed by AEG is for reference
         purposes only, and does not constitute a title.
         References to "different" and "same" titles follow the rules for "different" and
         "same" keywords.
         CARD SUBTITLES #
         Subtitles in smaller font inside the title bar, and the comma that separates them
         from the card title, are not part of the card title (For example, Hiruma Nikaru, The
         Flesh Eater has the title "Hiruma Nikaru" for play purposes.) Subtitles can be
         referred to by game text (for example, Mirumoto Tsuda with the subtitle
         "Emerald Champion" counts as an "Emerald Champion" card.)
         TEXT BOX #
         All cards also have a text box. This can contain up to three game-relevant
         elements: Keywords, which are printed in all caps above a separating line; traits,
         or normal text in the text box; abilities, or normal text preceded by boldface
         words in the text box. The text box also includes color text and Óavor text.
         STATS #
         Force, Chi, Province Strength and Gold Cost are examples of stats, or number
         values. Stats may gain bonuses or penalties from effects in the game, and effects
         may also give stats a minimum or maximum value.
         MINIMUMS AND MAXIMUMS #
         Minimums and maximums are applied on top of any existing bonuses, penalties,
         or modiÒers. If multiple minimums or multiple maximums apply, use the most
         restrictive one (for example, a minimum of 1 overrides a minimum of 0, and a
         maximum of 0 overrides a maximum of 5); note that this does not cover "to a
         minimum/maximum" wording, which has its own meaning.
         In the event that a stat receives a minimum value that is above its existing
         maximum value, or a maximum that is below its minimum, the minimum and
         maximum cancel each other out; neither one is applied until the other one ends.
         Most stats have a basic minimum value of zero. Only Honor Requirement, Family
         Honor, and modiÒers with a + or - sign can have negative values.
         ABSENT STATS #
         If an effect checks a stat's value that is absent on the card type (for example, a
         Spell's Force) the value is zero. Absent values cannot receive bonuses, penalties
         or modiÒers. If a side at a battleÒeld has no units, its total army Force is treated
         as an absent stat.
         CALCULATING STATS #
         If anyone needs to know a stat's value at any time, apply all current modiÒers,
         bonuses and penalties Òrst, then apply any minimum or maximum value.
         Example: If a card with 2 Force gets a -3F penalty, apply the penalty, then the
         basic minimum of zero. This means that the card's Force is zero for all purposes,
         not -1. If it then gets a +2F bonus, apply the bonus, the penalty, and the
         minimum, so that it now has 1 Force.
         BONUSES AND PENALTIES #
         Any change in a stat's value is considered a bonus (if increased) or penalty (if
         decreased), with the following exceptions:
         0.1. ModiÒers to Personality stats from the modiÒer stats on attached
         Items are not bonuses or penalties. Other text on items gives
         bonuses or penalties as normal.
         0.2. ModiÒers to Stronghold stats from the modiÒer stats on Sensei
         are not bonuses or penalties.
         0.3. When a maximum or minimum is applied, any change in the stat
         because of this is not a penalty or bonus.
         0.4. When a bonus, penalty, maximum, or minimum ends or is
         negated, the resulting stat change is not a penalty or bonus.
         0.5. A Óuctuating bonus or penalty is one that explicitly changes with
         the game state. Example: A card that has +1F for each Samurai in play.
         Changes in the size of a Óuctuating bonus or penalty due to changes
         in the game state are not bonuses or penalties. Example: A card that
         has +1F for each Samurai in play goes from +3F to +2F when a Samurai is
         destroyed. This is not a Force penalty.
         0.6. Changes in total Force of a unit or army which are not due to
         changes to the Force of its component cards (for example, because of
         a Follower being destroyed) do not count as Force bonuses or
         penalties.
         0.7. A bonus or penalty of +0 or -0 is not counted as a bonus or
         penalty.
         MODIFYING CHANGES #
         Some things may increase, reduce, or set limits on changes to stats and values.
         Example: reducing an Honor gain or increasing a Force penalty.
         A change must always go in the direction speciÒed, or be zero otherwise:
         "Increase" or "gain" are always positive or zero, "reduce" or "loss" are always
         negative or zero. Initial calculations and effects cannot turn an increase to a
         reduction or vice versa.
         Changes to stats and values are calculated in the same way that stats themselves
         are calculated: all current increases and reductions to the change are applied, the
         change can never be less than zero, other minimums and maximums for the
         change are applied, and then the change is either added to the stat or value (if a
         bonus or gain) or subtracted from the stat or value (if a loss or penalty).
         Examples: Reductions to an Honor gain can never convert it into a loss, and increases
         to a Force penalty are ultimately reÓected in Force being reduced.
         TO A MINIMUM/TO A MAXIMUM #
         Bonuses, penalties and other stat changes that are restricted by "to a minimum"
         or "to a maximum" are applied after any other modiÒers, bonuses and penalties,
         and are limited in their amount by the stated minimum and maximum values.
         Example: If an Honor Loss of 3 that was decreased by 2 is reduced by 1 "to a
         minimum of 1," that penalty comes after the reduction of the Honor loss to 1, so the
         Ònal Honor loss is the minimum of 1.
         Note that "to a minimum/maximum" wording is different than a wording that
         restricts the number of things counted; for example "Give him +2F for each
         Holding you bowed, up to three (Holdings.)" This does not restrict the Ònal Force
         bonus, so under the effect "Increase his Force bonuses by 1," if 5 Holdings are
         bowed this would give +6F, which increases to 7F.
         ASTERISKS #
         An asterisk (*) appearing instead of a stat on a card means that the stat is
         variable, with a printed value of zero and actual value determined according to
         other circumstances.
         SETTING STATS TO VALUES #
         Various effects "set" a stat to some particular value. Some effects also exchange
         or copy stats, which involve setting stats to a particular value. To set a stat to a
         value, give it the smallest possible bonus or penalty as appropriate (or the
         smallest possible gain or loss, for Honor) such that it would reach that value, not
         counting maximums or minimums. Then, apply any maximum or minimum in
         effect for that stat.
         Example: A 3F Personality is under an effect giving him a maximum Force of 5, but has
         his Force raised to that of another Personality with 8F. The 3F Personality gets +5F, but
         after the maximum of 5 is applied has effectively only 5F. If he then received a -4 Force
         Penalty, this would be assessed against his bonus of +5F from the raising effect, and
         he would have base 3F +1F = 4.
         Effects that "raise," or "lower," a stat to a particular value use these rules as well,
         but will only give a bonus ("raise") or penalty ("lower").
         UNIT AND ARMY FORCE #
         The total Force of a unit or army outside of battle resolution counts all cards in
         that unit or army, bowed and unbowed. In battle resolution, bowed Personalities
         and Followers do not contribute to an army's total Force; bowed Items give their
         Force modiÒer directly to the Personality, who then contributes or not depending
         on whether he is bowed.
         GOLD COST STAT CHANGES #
         Effects that change how much is paid for a card (for example "enters play for 2
         less Gold" or "paying 2 more Gold") do not change the Gold Cost stat of the card
         itself after the payment is done.
         KEYWORDS #
         KEYWORDS #
         A keyword is a phrase of one or more words that usually appears at the top of a
         card's text box, above a dividing line. For example, a Personality can be aligned to
         the Phoenix Clan and be a Samurai.
         Keywords are separated from each other by solid dots (•). If keywords appear on
         more than one line in a text box, the ones on different lines are separate as well.
         A keyword may be made up of multiple words, like Geisha House, but it is treated
         as a single phrase; a "Geisha House" card is not a "Geisha" card.
         Multiple keywords created or granted by a trait or ability are separated only by
         bullets or commas, not by line breaks. Example: If "Phoenix Clan" wraps from one
         line to another within the text of an ability, it is treated as the two-word keyword
         "Phoenix Clan."
         Some terms embedded in the text (that is, appearing in quotation marks that
         grant a trait or ability) may appear in boldface, but they are not considered part
         of the card's keywords.
         "Battle," "Limited," "Open", "Engage," "Dynasty" and "Interrupt" appear in
         boldface, but are action designators, not keywords. Individual abilities can have
         their own keywords as well.
         A unit can have keywords—for example, "A Cavalry unit". See Unit.
         A card either has a given keyword or it does not. Effects that grant a keyword to a
         card that already has it do not give it an extra copy of the keyword, and do not
         protect that card against a future effect that would remove that keyword.
         BOLDFACE #
         Some keywords are boldface, showing that they have rules associated with them.
         Other keywords may work with effects on other cards but don't have meaning in
         the rules, and are not printed in boldface.
         However, when rules refer to "boldface," the physical boldfacing of keywords on
         cards is overriden by the keyword's rules relevance in the present arc. Appendix
         B gives a complete listing of keywords that should be boldface by the current arc
         rules.
         KEYWORD INHERITANCE #
         Keywords on abilities also apply to their cards. Example: A Strategy with a Political
         ability is a Political Strategy.
         Keywords on cards do not apply to their abilities. Example: An ability on a Ninja
         card is not a Ninja ability unless it says so, for example, "Ninja Battle:"
         DIFFERENT AND SAME KEYWORDS #
         These rules also apply to Clan Alignment.
         Two cards have the "same" keyword if they share one or more eligible keywords.
         Two cards have "different" keywords if, when all shared keywords are ignored,
         each card has an eligible keyword the other does not.
         With multiple keywords on cards, two cards can have both the same and
         different keywords.
         Example 1: A Personality with Dragon Clan and Scorpion Clan has both "a different"
         and "the same" Clan Alignment compared to a Personality with the Dragon Clan and
         Phoenix Clan keywords.
         Example 2: A Personality with Dragon Clan and Scorpion Clan does not have a
         different Clan Alignment from a Personality with the Dragon Clan keyword alone. The
         two Personalities only have the same Clan Alignment.
         When comparing more than two cards with multiple keywords, in order for all of
         them to be different from each other, each pair must be different from each
         other.
         A card without a certain type of keyword has neither a "different" nor "the same"
         keyword as another card.
         Example: An unaligned Personality has neither a different nor the same Clan
         Alignment as an unaligned Stronghold or player.
         NUMBER OF KEYWORDS #
         Effects that count the number of keywords on cards simply count the number of
         eligible keywords on those cards, ignoring duplicates. If there is only one eligible
         keyword, it is still counted; "different" does not imply there have to be two or
         more keywords.
         TRAITS #
         After keywords, the Òrst instances of plain text in a text box are traits: phrases in
         normal print that describe the card's effects or restrictions. Players and other
         game entities can also have traits.
         Each sentence that ends in a period in the traits section of a card is a separate
         trait.
         EXCEPTION: If a trait uses a pronoun or other language that can only refer back
         to something named in the previous sentence, the sentences are part of the
         same trait.
         Example: "Lose 2 Honor. This Personality may not issue challenges." are two separate
         traits because they make sense independently of each other. However, "After your turn
         begins: Target another player's Personality. This Personality challenges him." is a
         single trait because the "him" in the second sentence makes no sense without the
         previous sentence.
         As with keywords, if a thing in the game is given a trait it already has, it does not
         get an additional copy of that trait or become any more resistant to removal of
         that trait.
         TRIGGERED TRAITS #
         Triggered traits include a trigger - a timing reference such as "Before your turn
         ends," or "After this Personality enters play." Triggered traits happen every time
         that trigger occurs in the game, but only if the card they are on is (a) in play, (b) in
         the focusing area, (c) in a resolution or entering-play area, or (d) if they say they
         are triggered from an area not in play.
         Triggered traits are not optional - they must happen if the trigger occurs.
         Likewise, costs of triggered traits are not optional - they must be paid if the
         player can pay the cost.
         A triggered trait on a given card or stronghold happens once and only once each
         time that trigger occurs.
         The occurrence of a trait's trigger, and the successful meeting of any other
         conditions or costs, means that the trait resolves and its effects are applied in
         order, even if the card leaves play during the effects' application.
         Usage limits on traits in the general form "once (or twice, etc.) per turn (or phase,
         game, etc.)" mean that the trait is triggered every time the triggering condition is
         met, but its effects can only be applied a certain number of times. If the effects
         are optional, the "once per turn" restriction is only used up if the effects are
         actually chosen.
         If the effects of a triggered trait fail, the trait is still considered to have been
         activated for purpose of its maximum number of uses.
         TRIGGERED TRAIT COSTS AND TARGETING #
         Traits may sometimes have costs which must be paid to generate their effects.
         Targeting in a trait must be carried out if possible. If non-optional targeting fails,
         any further effects and targeting in the trait do not happen.
         SPECIAL TRIGGERED TRAITS #
         Gold-producing cards other than Holdings or Strongholds (that is, cards without a
         Gold Production stat) follow special rules for their traits that produce Gold.
         Traits that are triggered when paying a Gold cost, and whose effects produce
         Gold or reduce Gold costs, are optional; they do not have to be triggered when
         any given Gold cost is paid.
         Some Gold-producing cards have traits with the effect "Produce X Gold" which is
         shorthand for the triggered trait, "When paying a Gold cost, produce X Gold."
         Sentences following this phrase, prior to any other ability or triggered trait,
         should be read as additional effects of bowing to produce Gold.
         The trigger "As a Focus Effect:" refers to a particular point in a duel.
         Invest traits have special triggers.
         CONTINUOUS TRAITS #
         A trait without a trigger on a card, such as "Your Samurai each have +1F," is a
         continuous effect that is "always on" while the card is in play and while all
         conditions of the trait are met. While their card is out of play, continuous traits
         affect the card they are on, and only that card, unless the trait states otherwise.
         ABILITIES #
         Below any traits, there may be one or more abilities: blocks of text that describe
         actions that players can take at certain points in the game. An ability starts with
         one or more of the boldface terms Battle:, Dynasty:, Limited:, Open:, Interrupt: or
         Engage:. This term, the designator, tells when in the game the action can be
         taken.
         An ability with two designators, such as "Battle/Open:", can be used at either
         time. The ability always has both designators, but the action taken using it only
         has the designator appropriate to the Action Round when it is used.
         Abilities given to a card or player "stack," unlike keywords and traits. A card or
         player can have more than one identical copy of an ability, each of which is used
         separately.
         Each ability on each separate source is a separate ability, even if they are
         identical abilities or exist on identical cards.
         Example: The "once per turn" limit on using an ability does not prevent a player
         from using the ability on two identical cards in the same turn.
         Ability keywords: Abilities have keywords, which appear in boldface before the
         designator and are applied to the ability, its action and its effects. For
         relationships between card and ability keywords, see Keyword inheritance
         Each word in an ability's own keywords is a separate keyword.
         Example: A "Bushido Virtue" ability is a Bushido ability and a Virtue ability.
         COSTS #
         Sometimes, after the ability's designator, there is an icon of a bowing samurai, or
         of a gold coin with a number in it.
         Open: : Gain 1 Honor.
         Battle: : Give your target Personality +4F.
         These are costs, which may be found on traits as well as abilities. The Gold icon
         means that a Gold cost must be paid in order to take the action (or activate the
         trait's effects). If there is a star in the icon, it means that the player can choose
         to pay any amount of Gold, and the effect scales to the amount paid.
         The bowing icon means the player needs to bow the card the ability is on in order
         to take the action (or activate the trait's effects); if the card is already bowed, he
         or she cannot take the action.
         A card out of play cannot normally bow to pay costs. However, if an Interrupt
         action on a card is played to an action that brings it into play, the payment of the
         Interrupt's bow cost may be delayed until after the card enters play.
         EFFECTS #
         The text after the designator and cost describes the effects the action has when it
         resolves. Sometimes, an action's effects (after the colon) will allow Gold to be
         paid, or bow Personalities. These are not costs.
         In traits and abilities, a card may refer directly to its own title; for example, a card
         named 'Bayushi Rentatsu' may read "Bow Rentatsu." This refers to the card itself,
         and not to any other copy of the card with the same name.
         EMBEDDED TEXT #
         Embedded text appears within a trait or ability in quotation marks (") and usually
         is part of an effect that grants the embedded text as a trait or ability.
         Any features of embedded text are not a part of the text that contains them.
         Example: "Limited: Give a Personality "Ninja Battle: This Personality challenges a
         target Personality opposing him." The Limited ability is not a Battle or Ninja ability and
         does not create a challenge.
         FLAVOR, COLOR, CREDIT AND REMINDER TEXT #
         Flavor text and color text have no impact on the game. The small credit text lines
         along the lower edge of the card (expansion, numbering, rarity and artist name)
         and along the right edge of the card (story credits) also have no impact on the
         game.
         FLAVOR TEXT #
         Flavor text is found in italic face at the bottom of the text box.
         COLOR TEXT #
         Traits and abilities may also include color text (italic, no parentheses) that
         describes what the effects are simulating, but has no game impact. Color text will
         always be a separate sentence in italics. Example: "You suspect him of the taint."
         REMINDER TEXT #
         Reminder text is shown by italicized text in parentheses. It is there to help players
         remember the wording implication of the rules. It carries no rules implications
         itself, and sometimes intentionally describes effects in a shortened or nonstandard way (for example, using the word "dies," which does not exist in the
         game rules, for "is destroyed".)
         AREAS OF THE GAME #
         All cards in any given area are either in play or out of play; each area's description
         in this section will tell you which kind it is.
         Temporary areas are created in the course of play, such as during an attack or
         when playing a Strategy card, and cease to exist after they have served their
         purpose.
         Only a few areas are communal, potentially containing cards belonging to more
         than one player. Most areas, instead, are associated with players, so that each
         player has his or her own such area, normally containing his or her own cards.
         ENTERING AND LEAVING #
         The terms "enter" and "leave" refer to all forms of going to and from an area.
         Example: For a unit to "enter" an army, it can do so by movement, assignment,
         entering play there, or any other effect that causes it to go to the army from
         another location.
         The following is a list of areas in the game with their rules and characteristics.
         FATE AND DYNASTY DECKS #
         Out of play
         The decks are placed with the Dynasty deck on the left, the Fate deck on the right,
         and the Provinces in between.
         All cards in decks begin face-down. All cards that enter decks turn face-down
         before doing so.
         If a card a player owns is about to enter another player's deck, it enters the
         owner's deck instead in the same manner.
         If a card is about to enter the wrong deck (Dynasty vs. Fate) it goes into the
         correct deck instead.
         An effect that lets a player "look" at cards in a deck does not by itself allow the
         player to change their order.
         Nothing special happens if either deck contains no cards.
         If text allows an ability on a card in a deck to be used, it Òrst enters a resolution
         area in the same way as a card played from hand.
         PROVINCES #
         Out of play
         These areas are arranged in a row from left to right between the two decks. A
         player starts with four Provinces, created after Òrst shuÖing the decks. The
         Provinces are indicated by Òlling each one with a face-down Dynasty card from
         the top of the player's deck, left to right.
         Each Province normally holds a maximum of one Dynasty card. When a card
         leaves a Province and the Province then holds fewer than its maximum number
         of cards, effects triggered by the card leaving the Province or entering play
         resolve Òrst. Then, if the Province still holds fewer than its maximum number of
         cards, it is reÒlled with a face-down Dynasty card from the top of the Province's
         owner's deck, unless something else has reÒlled it.
         Some effects may make it possible for a Province to hold more than one Dynasty
         card. If that happens, things that happen to "the Dynasty card" in a Province
         happen to a Dynasty card chosen by the Province's owner.
         If the Dynasty deck becomes empty or otherwise cannot reÒll Provinces, empty
         Provinces are indicated by markers of some kind. If it then becomes possible
         again to Òll empty Provinces, immediately reÒll the Provinces face down, from left
         to right and from the top of the deck.
         Cards in Provinces may be face-up or face-down.
         If a Province is destroyed, any Dynasty cards in it and FortiÒcations attached to it
         go to the discard pile. This is not considered "discarding" the card. Any remaining
         Provinces, and the two decks, are pushed together to show the reduction of the
         player's Provinces.
         If a Fate card would enter a Province from play, it is discarded instead.
         If a Fate card would enter a Province from out of play, it goes to the top of its
         owner's Fate deck instead.
         Cards attached to a Province are not "in," nor can be discarded "from," that
         Province.
         DISCARD PILES #
         Out of play
         The Fate and Dynasty decks each have an associated discard pile. The Dynasty
         discard pile is to its left, and the Fate discard pile is to its deck's right.
         Cards enter discard piles face-up.
         The order of cards in the discard piles has no consequence for the game.
         If a card a player owns is about to enter another player's discard pile, it enters the
         owner's corresponding discard pile instead.
         DEAD #
         Special rules cover Personality cards in the discard pile. A Personality who is
         destroyed is in the dead state while he remains in the discard pile; the card is
         turned 90° in the pile, or otherwise set apart from other discarded cards there.
         This is not bowing.
         Personalities who are not dead in the discard pile, and all other cards in discard
         piles, are in the discarded state. There is no distinction between destroyed and
         discarded non-Personality cards while they are in the discard pile.
         Rarely, a dishonorable Personality may become discarded. In this case, indicate
         the card's dishonorable status in the discard pile by keeping it 180° upside down.
         HONORABLE AND DISHONORABLE DEAD #
         A dead Personality who was honorable when last destroyed remains honorable
         and is known as ''honorably dead'' (turned 90° clockwise, or right side up if kept
         separately)
         A dead Personality who was dishonorable when last destroyed remains
         dishonorable and is known as ''dishonorably dead'' (turned 90° counterclockwise,
         or upside down if kept separately).
         HAND #
         Out of play
         Each player starts with Òve face-down Fate cards as a hand, drawn from the top
         of his or her Fate deck. A player may look at the cards in his or her hand at any
         time.
         Cards become face-down when they enter the hand, and can not become face-up
         while in the hand.
         A player may rearrange any number of cards in his or her hand that have the
         same owner at any time, except when this will cause a sequence of effects on the
         same card to become unveriÒable.
         Example: When an action asks the player to show a card in his or her hand, then
         shuÖe it back into the deck, the cards may not be rearranged between the two
         effects.
         If a Dynasty card is about to enter the hand, it instead goes to the top of its
         owner's Dynasty deck.
         HOME #
         In play
         The home is the area where a player's Stronghold is located and where cards
         usually enter play. It is represented by the area in front of the Provinces and
         decks. It is also a location.
         A Personality will not move to, enter play in, or otherwise change location to the
         home of a player who does not control the Personality, unless the Personality is
         also changing control to the new player. An effect that moves a Personality or
         unit to an unspeciÒed "location" will not allow the home of a non-controller
         player to be chosen.
         OUTSIDE THE GAME #
         Out of play; communal23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 26/101
         "Outside the game" is an area where both players, in separate piles, put cards
         they own that have been removed from the game. Cards removed from the
         game become face-up when they enter this area. Cards outside the game will not
         enter other areas unless an effect speciÒcally says it returns them from outside
         the game.
         Example: A card that is removed from the game by an effect, but is under a
         delayed effect that says "Discard this card at the end of the turn," will not enter
         the discard pile at the end of the turn.
         BATTLEFIELDS #
         In play; communal; temporary
         BattleÒelds are areas created during an attack or by a card effect that creates a
         battle. Together with each player's home, they are locations during the attack or
         battle.
         BattleÒelds associated with adjacent Provinces are themselves adjacent.
         BattleÒelds not associated with a Province are not adjacent to any other
         battleÒeld.
         If multiple battleÒelds are associated with a single Province, they are treated as
         battleÒelds arranged in a line between the Óanking Provinces, if any. The leftmost
         is adjacent to the Province on the left, the rightmost to the Province on the right,
         and each of the multiple battleÒelds is adjacent to its neighbor(s) within that
         Province.
         Terrains in play for a battle are located at the relevant battleÒeld but are not in
         any army or side. FortiÒcations are located at the battleÒeld associated with their
         Province.
         Effects that move units to, or create units at, a battleÒeld normally put the units
         into the unit's controller's own side and army there.
         BattleÒelds associated with adjacent Provinces are themselves adjacent.
         BattleÒelds not associated with a Province are not adjacent to any other
         battleÒeld.
         If a Province is destroyed, for any reason, other than during battle resolution, its
         battleÒeld immediately ceases to exist.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 27/101
         Even though a subsequent attack or effect may create a battleÒeld associated
         with the same Province as a previously existing battleÒeld, the new battleÒeld is a
         different area from the old battleÒeld.
         SIDE #
         Sides are sub-areas of battleÒelds that hold the armies belonging to the opposing
         players. Some non-unit cards (for example, a Terrain) may be in play at a
         battleÒeld, but those cards do not exist in either side or army.
         The Attacker and Defender each have their own side. When a player assigns his
         or her Personalities and units to a battleÒeld, moves them to a battleÒeld, or
         brings them into play at a battleÒeld, they go to the player's own side there.
         FOCUSING AREA #
         Out of play; temporary
         During a duel, each player focuses cards in his or her own focusing area. Cards in
         a focusing area are normally focused face down and then turned face up after a
         strike is called.
         Once a card is in a player's focused cards area, that player may look at it and the
         other cards there, but may not look at another player's face-down focused cards.
         FOCUSED CARD #
         The term "focused card" refers to a card currently in the focusing area. This is not
         necessarily restricted to cards that entered that area by being focused.
         ENTERING-PLAY AREAS #
         Out of play; temporary
         When checking conditions and costs of a card entering play, through Equip,
         Recruit, or other means, the card in question exists in a special temporary area;
         face-up but out of play.
         RESOLUTION AREA #
         Out of play; temporary
         After announcing an action from an ability on a Strategy or other card in a
         player's hand, or from an Event in a Province, the card in question is placed in a
         special temporary area, face-up but out of play.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 28/101
         If an effect of the action puts the card into play, it goes from the resolution area
         to a new entering-play area. If it fails to enter play, it returns to the resolution
         area, and is discarded after the action or event ends.
         If the card discards itself from the hand as part of its ability, this discard is done
         from the resolution area.
         UNDER ANOTHER CARD #
         Out of play
         Some effects may put cards under another card. Each group of cards under a
         separate card is a separate area.
         Cards under another card are face-down unless otherwise speciÒed. The owner
         of cards under another card can look at them at any time.
         If a card leaves play, all cards under it leave play in the same manner.
         GAME AREA KNOWLEDGE #
         Each player is normally entitled to know the following things in the game without
         needing effects to do so:
         0.1. The title, stats, and text of the most recent printing (MRP) of any
         player's face-up cards, including those in discard piles; and of any
         cards in the player's own hand or focus pool.
         0.2. The game state of all cards and other entities in the game,
         including ongoing effects, and stat totals relevant to game
         procedures.
         0.3. The details of any game procedures using face-up cards that is
         being carried out by another player (for example, how they are
         assigning units, or how they are producing Gold).
         0.4. Each player's Family Honor and number of cards in hand.
         Players are not normally entitled to know, without in-game effects, the following
         things:
         0.1. The number of cards currently in a deck, even their own.
         0.2. The order or identity of face-down cards in decks or Provinces,
         even their own.
         0.3. The identity of face-down cards in other players' hands or
         focusing areas.
         PHYSICAL CARD STATES #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 29/101
         PHYSICAL CARD STATES #
         IN PLAY AND OUT OF PLAY #
         Whether a card is in or out of play is determined by the game area it is in.
         Cards that are not either in play or in a resolution, entering-play or focusing area
         have the following limitations:
         0.1. They may not be targeted.
         0.2. Abilities on them may not be used, and triggered traits on them
         are not triggered.
         0.3. They may not be bowed to pay costs.
         0.4. Their continuous traits do not produce effects on anything but
         the card itself.
         0.5. They are not inÓuenced by effects. EXCEPTION: A delayed effect
         can affect a card out of play if it was in play when the effect was
         activated.
         The above limitations are overridden by a reference to cards in an out-of-play
         area, or to a card that would normally be put in an out-of-play area by an effect
         being referred to.
         Examples: "Target a discarded card"; "Your Samurai enter play paying 1 less Gold";
         "After one of your cards is destroyed"; "All Samurai in and out of play."
         Similarly, if an Interrupt creates an effect that triggers after its card enters play,
         the Interrupt can be used for the action that brings it into play.
         Each of the limitations must be overridden separately, and is overridden only for
         the speciÒc area or areas mentioned or implied.
         Example: "After a target card is discarded: Put it in your hand" speciÒcally targets a
         discarded card, and speciÒcally tells you to put it in another out-of-play area (your
         hand), so both effects work. It does not allow you to use an ability on the card while it
         is out of play, or to have it produce effects.
         BOWED AND UNBOWED #
         Some effects and costs turn a card 90° clockwise to indicate a state of
         unreadiness. This state is known as "bowed" and cards not in this state are
         "unbowed." See also Remain.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 30/101
         When a card goes from unbowed to bowed, the card "bows". When a card goes
         from bowed to unbowed, the card "straightens."
         Only cards in play can bow or straighten, or have the bowed or unbowed state.
         Cards, other than non-FortiÒcation Holdings, enter play in the unbowed state.
         When a card enters play bowed, it is not considered to bow, because it was not in
         play as an unbowed card.
         Abilities on a bowed card cannot be used and bowed Personalities cannot assign.
         HONORABLE AND DISHONORABLE #
         A Personality card is sometimes turned 180° upside down to indicate a state of
         disgrace (or exposure, in the case of Personalities with no concept of honor). This
         state is known as "dishonorable" and Personalities not in this state are
         "honorable." A Personality who is both dishonorable and bowed should have the
         top of his or her card facing left instead of right, indicating the 90° turn of bowing
         plus the 180° turn of dishonorable status.
         Only Personalities can be honorable or dishonorable. Personalities are normally
         honorable unless a cost or effect has made them dishonorable.
         When a personality goes from honorable to dishonorable, he or she is
         "dishonored." When a personality goes from dishonorable to honorable, he or
         she is "rehonored."
         A face-up Personality out of play can be dishonorable or honorable. Leaving or
         entering play does not change a Personality's dishonorable or honorable status.
         Dishonorable Personalities have a maximum Personal Honor of zero.
         After a dishonorable Personality is destroyed, the player who controlled him or
         her loses Honor equal to the Personality's printed Personal Honor. This is a
         rulebook effect, not a card effect.
         REHONORING #
         There are a number of ways to rehonor dishonorable Personalities.
         0.1. Before a player gains one or more points of Honor from an action
         or trait that targeted or came from one or more of his or her
         dishonorable Personalities. If rehonoring the Personalities is not one23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 31/101
         of that action or trait's effects, the dishonorable Personalities'
         rehonoring is substituted for the Honor gain.
         0.2. Before a player gains Honor from attaching a card to one of his or
         her dishonorable Personalities, the Personality's rehonoring is
         substituted for the Honor gain.
         0.3. Before a player with one or more dishonorable Personalities in
         his or her army gains Honor from destroying enemy cards in battle
         resolution, all such dishonorable Personalities are rehonored,
         substituting for the Honor gain. In a tied battle, all dishonorable
         Personalities in an army are rehonored before being destroyed, in
         substitution for their army's leader's Honor gain.
         The rules on substitution mean that preventing the Honor gain also prevents its
         substituted rehonoring and if, during one of these effects, the rehonoring is
         negated or otherwise fails, the Honor is still not gained.
         DISCARDED AND DEAD #
         "Dead" is a special state that only applies to some Personalities in the discard
         pile. All other cards in discard piles are merely "discarded" instead.
         LOCATIONS #
         Cards in play have a location - the home or a battleÒeld. Areas out of play are not
         locations.
         Cards enter play in their controller's home.
         Cards that are not in a unit can only be in a player's home while in play.
         EXCEPTION: Terrains and FortiÒcation Holdings are in play at their battleÒeld.
         When a unit goes from one location to another, it moves.
         EXCEPTION: The following changes of location are not movement: assigning to a
         battleÒeld, entering a player's home or other area due to change of control,
         returning home after a battle, and returning home due to a battleÒeld ceasing to
         exist.
         When a unit "moves home" it moves to its controller's home.
         MOVING TO ATTACK/DEFEND #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 32/101
         When a unit "moves to attack" it moves into the attacking side of a battleÒeld.
         SpeciÒcally, moving to attack also includes moving between two battleÒelds on
         the attacking side. "Move to defend" has a parallel meaning involving the
         defending side.
         ATTACHMENTS AND TOKENS #
         The particular Personality that an attachment is attached to is considered a
         physically marked state of the attachment.
         The reverse is not true; which attachments a Personality has are not part of the
         Personality's physically marked state.
         Tokens on any type of card are part of its physical state.
         CARD CONTROL #
         Cards come in play controlled by the player who brought them into play.
         EXCEPTIONS: An attached card in a unit is controlled by the unit's Personality's
         controller. A FortiÒcation or other card attached to a province is controlled by the
         player whose province it is.
         Only the controller of a card may use its abilities or use it to pay costs.
         Immediately after a player successfully takes control of another player's nonattachment card:
         • if the card is at a battleÒeld, it goes to the new player's side of the battleÒeld,
         attaching to one of the new controller's legal Personalities there if necessary;
         • otherwise, it enters the new player's home.
         An attachment card that changes control must be transferred to one of the new
         controller's Personalities who can legally attach it.
         To control a Clan Alignment means to control a card with that Clan Alignment.
         Changing control is instantaneous and does not have a duration.
         CARD OWNERSHIP #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 33/101
         A card is owned by the player whose play deck it was originally in, or the player
         who brought it into play if the card was created or brought in from outside the
         play deck. A card's ownership can not change.
         FACE UP AND FACE DOWN #
         A card, in or out of play, is either face up or face down. The card's current area of
         play will often determine its default status, and for some areas of play, cards
         cannot exist face up or face down.
         MATERIAL DESTRUCTION #
         An effect may call for the material destruction of a card (for example, "tear this
         card in half"). A card that has been materially destroyed is removed from the
         game, is no longer part of its owner's decks, and may not be included in decks in
         any future game.
         GAME MECHANICS #
         PAYING GOLD COSTS #
         The Stronghold and Gold-producing Holdings can be bowed to produce Gold
         when an action or trait calls for a Gold cost to be paid (most usually in the Pay
         Costs step, B, of the action sequence). Other cards may also have traits allowing
         them to produce Gold when called for. The amount of Gold produced can be
         read from a Stronghold's or Holding's Gold Production stat, or from the text on
         another card type.
         If a player produces more Gold than is needed to pay a cost, the extra Gold is
         added to the player's Gold pool, and is available to help pay other costs later in
         that phase of the game. At the end of each phase, any unspent Gold in the pool
         disappears into the hands of Imperial tax collectors.
         Example: Your unbowed Crane Clan Stronghold has a Gold Production of 4. You also
         have a 'Marketplace' Holding and a 'Border Keep' Holding in play and unbowed. The
         'Marketplace' bows to produce 3 for you and the 'Border Keep' bows to produce 2.
         If you now wish to buy a card that costs you 8 Gold, you need to bow all three of
         these cards to produce 9. This is because the most you can produce from any
         two of them is 7. The extra 1 Gold is available to pay costs later in that phase, and
         may be used on its own or combined with further Gold production from
         Holdings.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 34/101
         EXCEPTION: Some Gold production says it may only pay for a certain cost or type
         of cost, with wording such as "This Holding has +2GP if this only pays for a single
         Follower". The choice to have the extra GP is taken at the point of producing Gold
         with that source. If the extra GP is taken, that Gold is tracked separately, does not
         enter the pool, and cannot pay for anything else than the action (including
         Recruit/Equip) for which the Gold was produced; excess production disappears
         after the Pay Costs step of the action.
         If there is a mixture of restricted and unrestricted Gold sources in paying a cost,
         the player may choose the order of payment, which determines whether
         Gold enters the pool or not. Example: If paying a 4 Gold cost with 3G from a
         restricted source and 2G from an unrestricted source, the player may choose to have
         the 2G paid last toward the cost, so that the unrestricted Gold can enter the pool.
         Gold paid for a Recruit or Equip action, or for an action with a Recruit or Equip
         effect, is considered to pay both the cost of the action and the cost of the card
         Recruited or Equipped.
         GOLD-PRODUCING TRAITS #
         If a card bows to produce Gold, and that production has or triggers other effects
         that depend on what it is paying for or bringing into play, these effects only look
         at the payment for which the card bowed, not any future payments from left-over
         extra Gold.
         ACTION ROUNDS #
         All actions are taken during an Action Round, with the type of Action Round
         determining which types of action may be taken, and who gets the Òrst
         opportunity to act. The player with the opportunity to act may take an action or
         pass, and the opportunity then passes to the next player in turn order. After all
         player pass consecutively, the Action Round ends.
         The types of Action Round are:
         • Action Phase: The active player may take Open and Limited actions; other
         players may take Open actions. The active player has the Òrst opportunity to act.
         • Engage Segment: All players may take Engage Actions. The Defender has the
         Òrst opportunity to act.
         • Combat Segment: All players may take Battle Actions. The Defender has the Òrst
         opportunity to act.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 35/101
         • Dynasty Phase: The active player may take Dynasty Actions, and has the first
         opportunity to act.
         • Interrupt Step: All players may take Interrupt Actions. The active player has the
         Òrst opportunity to act.
         TAKING ACTIONS #
         Players can normally take actions from abilities on Strategies and Rings in their
         hand, from abilities on their non-Event cards in play, from abilities on Events
         face-up in their Provinces (but not in play), or from abilities given to the player by
         the rules or card effects.
         Rarely, the existence of an ability may depend on a condition being met. Example:
         While Domo is honorable, he has the ability, "Battle: Ranged 4 Attack." When such an
         ability is used, it is considered to have been used that turn (or other amount of
         time) even if the condition fails to be met, and is met again, within that time.
         LIMITED ACTIONS #
         May be taken in the Action Phase only by the active player (the player whose turn
         it is).
         OPEN ACTIONS #
         May be taken in the Action Phase by any player.
         ENGAGE ACTIONS #
         May only be taken during a battle's Engage Segment.
         BATTLE ACTIONS #
         May only be taken during a battle's Combat Segment.
         INTERRUPT ACTIONS #
         These actions are taken only in the Interrupt step of a non-Interrupt action,
         following an action round which begins with the active player.
         An Interrupt may modify the effects of the action it interrupts - including
         preventing some or all of these effects - and it may also have effects of its own.
         An Interrupt's effects do not change actions other than the one it interrupted,
         unless explicitly stated.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 36/101
         Phrases in an Interrupt's effects such as "After a Personality is destroyed" refer to
         the effects of the interrupted action, and are delayed until those effects occur;
         they do not refer to when the Interrupt is played. This will usually mean that the
         interrupted action's player can target or make other choices in the action after
         the Interrupt is played, knowing it will take effect.
         References to "the action" in an Interrupt also mean the action being interrupted.
         DYNASTY ACTIONS #
         These actions are taken during the Dynasty phase by the active player.
         USING ABILITIES #
         There are three limitations on using abilities:
         0.1. Abilities on bowed cards may not normally be used.
         0.2. To use its abilities, a card must be: in play, an Event in the player's
         Province, or a Strategy or Ring that is being played from the player's
         hand, using its ability from a resolution area. EXCEPTION: Interrupt
         abilities on a card out of play may be taken if they Interrupt the action
         that brings the card into play. In this case, if the action has a "bow this
         card" cost, it is satisÒed by bowing the card after it enters play, as a
         delayed effect.
         0.3. Each separate card ability and player ability may normally only be
         used once per turn. Abilities on two different cards with the same title
         are separate, though, and both can be used in the same turn.
         GOOD FAITH RULE #
         To legally announce an action, a player must be able to:
         0.1. pay its costs,
         0.2. meet any targeting of the action that is not optional, delayed, or
         done by another player, including targeting in Ranged and Melee
         Attacks and Fear effects;
         0.3. meet the conditions of any phrase beginning with "If" that starts
         the action's effects (such as "If you are the Attacker, …").
         0.4. Favor actions require that their player control the Imperial Favor,
         or have an alternate effect, substitute, or waiver ("need not") for
         discarding the Favor.
         0.5. Actions that base their required targeting on a variable Gold cost
         paid require that the player can, and does, pay the Gold cost that
         corresponds to a legal target.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 37/101
         0.6. The rulebook Equip and Recruit actions, likewise, require that the
         player can and does pay the Gold cost that corresponds to a legal
         card to bring into play.
         0.7. In the special case where an Interrupt action on a card is
         announced before its card enters play, the costs and requirements
         for that card to enter play must be met in Good Faith, and the card
         itself must be chosen to enter play.
         Otherwise, a player may announce and take an action even if it will have no
         effects.
         The Good Faith rule takes into account future changes in the game state that are
         known to the player. Example: if Bob plans to play an Interrupt that gives the action
         a target it wouldn't have when he announced it, this allows him to play the action, but
         also requires him to play that Interrupt having announced it.
         ACTION SEQUENCE #
         The steps in taking an action are as follows. The action's player, in turn:
         A. Announces the action, saying which card or player ability he is using to take the
         action, and showing the card if the ability is on a Strategy or Ring in your hand.
         B. Pays any costs of the action. Only the bowing and Gold icon in an ability are
         costs.
         During the Pay Costs step, if the action has a Gold cost (or if a targeting paradox
         makes it potentially have one), its player may produce Gold and then pay for the
         action using the Gold just produced and Gold in that player's Gold pool. Any Gold
         produced that is not spent on the action goes to the player's Gold pool.
         C. Chooses any targets of the action that are not delayed, optional, or chosen by
         another player. These choices deÒne the action's targeting for purposes of
         Interrupts and any other effects that check targeting. However, they do not
         actually trigger effects that depend on targeting.
         D. Gives all players a chance to play Interrupts to the action. only be taken in the
         Interrupt step of a non-Interrupt action23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 38/101
         E. Resolves the action (action resolution), carrying out out the action's effects in
         the order mentioned by the ability. Targeting as chosen in step C is now actually
         carried out when called for by the card text, possibly altered by Interrupts or
         other effects. Delayed, optional, and other-player targeting is also carried out
         during resultion. If an effect requires a target and the player cannot Ònd a legal
         target, the effects stop immediately, and no further effects or targeting happen.
         An action's resolution happens even if all its effects are negated or otherwise fail.
         Once the action resolution has begun, effects that inÓuence the action's ability to
         have been taken in the Òrst place do not inÓuence the activation of the action's
         effects.
         Example: If an action's required targeting becomes illegal during resolution, or
         the ability's card leaves play during resolution, all remaining effects are still
         activated.
         When all effects of the action have been activated, the resolution is done and the
         action ends.
         F. Finally, if the player took the action from a Strategy, or from another card type
         in hand, he or she discards it unless it is now in play.
         EFFECTS #
         DEFINITION OF EFFECTS #
         An effect is anything, other than a cost, that creates a card or other thing in the
         game, changes the characteristics or state of a card, stat or other thing in the
         game, adds restrictions or permissions to the game's procedures, or creates a
         new instance of a game procedure.
         Each individual change or creation of a card, a player, a game entity (such as
         Provinces), or a game procedure is a separate effect.
         Targeting and costs are not effects. Aspects of card memory (such as the fact that
         a card has been in a battle this turn, or has used its ability) are also not effects.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 39/101
         An effect is not necessarily equal to a sentence. One sentence may contain
         multiple effects (for example, "Bow two Samurai and gain 2 Honor" creates 3
         effects.) Also, a sentence referring directly to and modifying an effect in a
         previous sentence from the same source text, is part of that effect (for example,
         in "Gain 2 Honor. This gain will not be negated," "This gain will not be negated" is
         part of the "Gain 2 Honor effect.")
         EFFECTS AND ABILITIES "ON" A CARD #
         An effect "on" or "upon" a particular card is an effect that modiÒes any of:
         0.1. the card's stats, traits, keywords, abilities, tokens, ability to
         perform actions, ability to have attachments, or physically marked
         state.
         0.2. the use of one of those things
         0.3. changes to one of those things
         To be "on" a card, an effect need not specify the individual card; for example, an
         effect that destroys all cards at the battleÒeld is an effect on each card it
         destroys.
         This is different from an ability "on" a card, which refers to an ability printed on or
         granted to a card.
         INDEPENDENCE OF EFFECTS #
         Each of an action or trait's effects happens separately regardless of whether
         other effects can be applied.
         There are two exceptions:
         0.1. failing to meet targeting will stop later effects from happening
         (see step C of the action sequence, above)
         0.2. effects linked by the word "to" mean that the second effect
         depends on the Òrst effect actually happening; likewise, effects linked
         by the word "as" or "after" mean the Òrst effect depends on the
         second.
         Example: "Bow your Samurai to draw two cards" means the player only draws the
         cards if the Samurai actually goes from the unbowed to bowed state. The player
         doesn't draw the cards if the Samurai was already bowed at the time, or if something
         prevented him from bowing. Likewise, "Bow him as he moves" means the bowing
         doesn't happen if the moving is prevented.
         DURATION OF EFFECTS #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 40/101
         DURATION OF EFFECTS #
         INSTANTANEOUS #
         Some effects, as well as bowing to pay costs, are instantaneous, and marked by
         or physically marked changes to the game components, such as bowing cards,
         adding tokens, and changes to Family Honor. These changes do not wear off by
         themselves.
         Effects that add game procedures, such as duels, battles or additional phases, are
         known as procedural and are also treated as instantaneous; they insert the
         procedure into the game at a given moment in time.
         ONGOING #
         Other effects involve changes that are ongoing. That is, they last until a certain
         point in the game, and are not physically marked by the game components.
         These include changes to stats such as "Give a target attacking Personality +2F,"
         as well as changes to abilities, traits, keywords and conditions of things in the
         game, such as giving a card the trait, "This Personality will not bow."
         All ongoing effects last until the end of the current turn, unless they give a
         different duration.
         CONTINUOUS #
         Finally, non-triggered traits like "Your Samurai have +1F" have continuous effects that
         apply while the card is in play and all conditions on the trait, if any, are met (see Traits,
         previous section). If a continuous effect ceases to apply, then is reapplied, it is a new
         effect; for example, a Force bonus that was negated by an ongoing effect will reassert
         itself.
         CARD MEMORY RULE #
         If a card is both out of play and face-down (including returning to the hand), it
         "forgets" ongoing effects speciÒc to it, and other changes such as whether its abilities
         have been used. A card does not "forget" generic effects such as "All Samurai in and
         out of play have +1F."23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 41/101
         EXCEPTION: A card's role in a series of consecutively applied costs and effects from a
         single source is not "forgotten" from one effect to the other — for example, if a player
         is asked to draw a card and then show it, he or she must show the same card. If a card
         being tracked in this way is in a deck that is then shuÖed, the tracked card is set aside
         during the shuÖing; if it then needs to return to the deck, it is shuÖed in again.
         ORDER OF EFFECTS #
         Effects occur in the order they are written.
         EXCEPTION 1: Phrases modifying effects that come after the effect's text are applied at
         the same time as the effect. Such phrases will directly refer to the effect, increasing or
         reducing its restrictions or scope. Modifying phrases that refer to multiple effects refer
         to all relevant effects in that trait or ability.
         Example: In an effect that creates several duels, the duel consequence "Destroy each duel's
         loser" is applied immediately after each duel, following the duel sequence.
         EXCEPTION 2: Phrases in an ability's effects that refer to an ability itself, such as "This
         ability may be used once per battle," or "This ability will not be copied," apply to the
         ability at all times, even when the ability is not being used.
         EXCEPTION 3: Battles created by effects, and additional phases, segments, and actions
         granted by effects, are delayed until the action or triggered trait that granted them
         has ended.
         Example: Ambush reads, "Fight a battle there. After the battle ends, lose 5 Honor." The
         battle is delayed until the "Lose 5 Honor" effect has been activated, and the action has
         resolved. The Honor loss itself is a delayed effect timed to the end of the battle, and is only
         actually applied after the battle ends.
         Some effects logically involve targeting Òrst, even though the targeting is written after
         the effect; for example, in "Bow your target Personality," the target has to be chosen
         before it can be bowed.
         DELAYED EFFECTS #
         Effects that will occur at a given time in the future are delayed effects.
         Example: "After your next turn begins" or "After the next time this game a Samurai assigns
         to attack."23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 42/101
         The duration of a delayed ongoing effect takes into account the turn, or other time
         period, in which it was applied - not the time period in which it was initially activated.
         Example: in "After the start of your next turn, give him +2F," the Force bonus lasts until the
         end of your next turn.
         A delayed effect that has been activated but not yet applied is an ongoing effect, and
         can still be prevented by something that prevents effects in general, such as "effects of
         that action do not happen." However, something that prevents a speciÒc type of
         effect, such as bowing, will only negate a delayed effect when it is actually applied.
         When an effect delays another effect, if the delayed effect has already happened, the
         delaying has no effect.
         INDEFINITE CONDITIONAL EFFECTS #
         Some effects create other effects whenever a certain condition is met; these are
         collectively known as indeÒnite conditional effects. The creating effect is a "parent"
         effect, and the conditional effects are "child" effects. Parent effects are different from
         delayed effects, which create deÒnite effect(s) at a set time in the future.
         Example: In "After the next time this turn a Personality is destroyed, gain +1F" the +1F is a
         delayed effect; but, in "After each time this turn a Personality is destroyed, gain +1F" the +1F
         is not a delayed effect, but a child effect of the larger conditional effect.
         RESTRICTIONS ON NUMBER OF TIMES #
         Some effects restrict the number of times a type of occurrence can happen in a time
         period.
         Example: "You can only issue one challenge per turn."
         If such a restricting effect takes place in the middle of the time period covered,
         previous occurrences of the restricted effect count against the limit.
         Example: When "You can only issue one challenge per turn" resolves, any challenges you
         issued that turn count against the limit (even if you issued more than one) and any further
         challenges you issue that turn fail.
         PERMISSIONS #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 43/101
         Some text permits things to happen in violation of the rules, using terms such as "can"
         or "may." Such permissions override speciÒc restrictions and prevention effects in the
         rules; for example, "He may assign even if bowed."
         A permission does not break rules that it doesn't speciÒcally refer to.
         Example: "Your target Infantry Personality may assign in Cavalry Maneuvers" does not
         allow a bowed unit to assign.
         Likewise, a permission does not overcome restrictions or negations from card
         sources, unless overcoming card effects is speciÒcally mentioned.
         Example: If a card says its Ranged Attack "can target Personalities with attached Followers,"
         this does not overcome another effect that says "This Personality cannot be targeted by
         Ranged Attacks."
         TIMING #
         TRIGGERS #
         Triggered traits and some effects have an occurrence in the game they respond to,
         known as a trigger. Triggers are usually written as happening "before" or "after"
         something else.
         Some triggers refer to a time point in the game by what normally happens then, using
         the indeÒnite plural. These timings do not require that anything happens at that time
         point.
         Example: "After Focus Effects resolve in a duel" does not require that any Focus Effects
         actually resolved.
         Triggers worded using more deÒnite language, about an actual occurrence rather than
         the general time point, do require that the occurrence actually happen.
         Example: "After a Focus Effect resolves in a duel:" requires that a Focus Effect resolved.
         A trigger of "after" one step in a sequence ends will happen prior to the trigger of
         "before" the next step begins. Both triggers happen between the two steps.
         Example: A triggered trait with the trigger "after your Attack Phase ends" comes before a
         triggered trait with the trigger "before your Dynasty Phase begins," and happens in neither
         phase.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 44/101
         A phrase such as "before X would happen" is equivalent to "before X happens." The
         conditional mood indicated by "would" is irrelevant to the function of the "before"
         timing point.
         "IF" TRIGGERS #
         Effects that happen "if" or "if ever" other occurrences happen, and without any other
         timing wording, are timed "after" the other occurrence (such as the bowing in "If it
         now has zero Force, bow it" or the destruction in "If he is ever dishonorable, destroy
         him" - but not "If he is ever dishonorable, destroy him before the turn ends" which has
         its own timing wording).
         "WHEN" TRIGGERS #
         Timing "when" a trigger occurs comes later than "before" but earlier than "after" the
         trigger. "When" timing usually only appears in speciÒc cases:
         0.1. Effects that produce Gold and are triggered by a Gold payment are
         triggered explicitly or implicitly by "when" the payment occurs.
         0.2. Effects that alter a player's choice, such as targeting or assignment, are
         written as "when (the player) would." The timing of such a "when… would"
         effect occurs later than the player indicates his or her initial choice, but
         earlier than the point at which the targeting (or other outcome of the
         choice) actually happens.
         Example: "When another player would assign a unit to attack one of your provinces, you
         may assign it to a different province." Your choice to assign the unit comes after the player
         indicates his or her choice of assignment, and your choice then goes on to determine actual
         assignment.
         0.1. When a condition becomes true, any continuous traits and ongoing
         effects that depend on the condition begin "when" the thing happens that
         made the condition true. When a condition becomes false, any continuous
         traits and ongoing effects that depend on the condition likewise end at the
         "when" point.
         Example: "This card has +2F while bowed." The Force bonus is gained "when" the card bows
         and lost "when" the card straightens.
         Once a triggered trait starts, activate all its costs, targeting, and effects in sequence
         before proceeding, even if another action or triggered trait is under way.
         TIMING CONFLICTS #
         Two things in the game can happen at the same time (e.g., two Personalities being
         destroyed in battle resolution.) However, two triggered occurrences (e.g., Honor loss
         after a dishonorable Personality dies; delayed effects) will never begin at the same
         time.
         When simultaneous effects caused by a single piece of text create multiple game
         procedures containing more than one step, each step of each procedure takes place
         simultaneously, in parallel.
         Example: When instructed "The two target Samurai each commit Seppuku," the Seppuku
         play procedure actually has two effects in sequence. So, each Samurai simultaneously
         rehonors; then, each Samurai is destroyed.
         Timing conÓicts happen when multiple triggers either respond to the same
         occurrence, or to simultaneous occurrences (e.g., more than one Personality
         destroyed simultaneously in battle resolution; delayed effects generated by multiple
         copies of the same card).
         Multi-step procedures, such as bringing cards into play, follow special rules when they
         happen simultaneously. See Order of effects.
         If two or more traits or rules procedures are triggered at the same point in time,
         follow this sequence to decide their order.
         A: Delay, negation, prevention. Apply any ongoing, continuous, or triggered effects
         that delay, negate or prevent the occurrence that deÒnes the trigger. If more than one
         of these effects conÓict, the active player decides the order in which they happen.
         Example: An ongoing prevention effect says "Units will not move home." This
         prevention happens at the earliest step, so that no other triggered effects, traits or
         actions can respond to the unit's movement.
         B: Substitution. Apply any ongoing, continuous, or triggered effects that substitute
         the occurrence that deÒnes the trigger, making the occurrence not happen and
         something else happen instead. If more than one of these effects conÓict, the active
         player decides the order in which they happen. If a substituted effect has been
         delayed, the substitution still happens at the delayed point.
         Example: An ongoing substitution effect says "Units that move home are destroyed
         instead." Any negation and prevention of moving home happens Òrst, then the
         destruction substitution happens.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 46/101
         C: Triggered effects. Anything else that is triggered at this point happens now. This
         includes triggered traits, delayed effects, indeÒnite conditional effects, and triggered
         rulebook effects (such as losing Honor after a dishonorable Personality is destroyed).
         If more than one of these things conÓict, the active player decides the order in which
         they happen.
         CHOICES AND TARGETING #
         CHOICES #
         Sometimes a choice has to be made in the game. This includes alternate effects ("gain
         +2F or +1C"), optional effects ("may bow him"), variable effects ("up to three cards"),
         and assignment.
         If an action does not explicitly state which player makes a choice between several
         options, the choice belongs to the player taking the action. In traits, the choice belongs
         to the player whose card it is (that is, the controller of the card if it is in play, or its
         owner if it is not).
         A choice involving multiple effects following a "may" must be taken in an all-or-none
         fashion, unless they are phrased as alternatives to each other using "or."
         Example: "He may target one of his Shugenja and discard a card." If this choice is taken, the
         targeting and discard are both either carried out or not carried out; there is no option to
         target a Shugenja and not discard. Compare with "he may target one of his Shugenja and
         may discard a card," in which the two choices are separate; either, none, or both options
         may be taken. Also, in "he may target one of his Shugenja or discard a card," one choice or
         the other (but not both) may be taken.
         Regardless of these considerations, each of the effects following "may" is activated
         and applied separately, and can be negated separately.
         A choice may be made even if its consequences would fail or be prevented.
         Example: If a Personality is already bowed, or will not bow due to an effect, you may still
         make a choice to bow him. If you do not control any unbowed Personalities, you may also
         make a choice to "bow an unbowed Personality," which just fails.
         References to the result of a choice are phrased differently according to whether the
         choice was only made, or whether a choice made had any effect.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 47/101
         Example: "You may choose to bow the Personality. If you choose this, gain 2 Honor." If the
         bowing is somehow prevented or the Personality is already bowed, you still gain 2 Honor.
         Example: "You may bow the personality. If he bowed, gain 2 Honor." If the bowing is
         prevented or the Personality is already bowed, you do not gain the Honor.
         In assignment and targeting, references to the player who assigns or targets refer to
         the player who made the actual choice, not necessarily the player whose choice it
         originally was.
         CHOICE CONFLICTS #
         When effects restrict or force choice, conÓicts and paradoxes are resolved by
         removing all such conÓicting restrictions. This applies to positive restrictions such as
         "The action must target this card" as well as negative restrictions such as "This card
         may not be targeted if there are other legal targets."
         Example: Two cards in the same army say "This card must be chosen, if legal, as a target
         for enemy players' Battle actions." The paradox is that each card makes each other an
         illegal target, thus waiving the "must be chosen" effect, but then turning it on again because
         both are legal, and so on to inÒnity. In this situation, the restrictions cancel out, and both
         cards may be freely chosen as targets.
         CHOICE PARADOXES #
         If a choice (such as choosing a target, cost payment or announcing an Interrupt)
         requires information from another choice that has not been made yet, the player
         must make that second choice at the time of targeting or payment, as a prerequisite
         for the Òrst choice. He or she must also stay with that choice through the rest of the
         action or trait in question, until the choice is oÕcially called for. In such a situation, if
         the game state changes so that the choice is no longer valid, then the player cannot
         make an alternate choice; the cost is not paid, or the effect fails, as appropriate.
         CONTINUOUS EFFECT CONFLICTS #
         If two continuous card effects conÓict, then the more speciÒc effect (applying to a
         more exclusive category of cards) overcomes the more general effect. Effects on a
         single card are more exclusive than effects applying to a card with a particular
         keyword or trait, which in turn are more exclusive than effects that apply to all cards
         of a particular type. With two effects of equal speciÒcity, the effect applied later
         overcomes the effect applied earlier. Card effects always overcome rules effects by
         the Cardinal Rule.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 48/101
         Example: If a Kensai Personality's text says "May only attach one Weapon" and an Event
         comes into play that says "Your Personalities may attach two Weapons," the text speciÒcally
         applying to the Personality overcomes the Event's general text.
         TARGETING #
         Targeting is a special kind of choice that involves designating one or more cards or
         other game entities (such as a Province or player). Targets are chosen at an early step
         of the Action Sequence, and targeting is carried out based on these choices, with any
         intervening changes, in the actions' resolution step.
         The word "target" must appear for the procedure to be considered targeting — just
         "choosing" something is not targeting.
         Cards must be in play to be legal targets, unless the ability says or implies otherwise
         (for example, "Target a dead Personality" implies he is in the discard pile.)
         Choosing a target comes before the actual targeting. SpeciÒcally, if an effect interferes
         with one player's action so that another player chooses one of the action's Ònal
         targets, the player of the action is still the one who "targets" the Ònal target.
         The phrase "target and [verb] X" means to target X, and to carry out the verb on the
         targeted object.
         Example: "Target and bow your Samurai" means to target one of your Samurai, and bow
         that same Samurai. The bowing depends on the targeting.
         When multiple targets are chosen simultaneously, the same target cannot be chosen
         twice. This also means that when one target out of multiple, already-chosen targets is
         being changed, another one of those already-chosen targets cannot legally become
         the new target.
         Example: If you target a Samurai and a Shugenja simultaneously, another player cannot
         change your targeting of the Samurai to target that Shugenja, because you have already
         chosen the Shugenja for the same targeting.
         REFERENCES TO TARGETING #
         New instances of targeting are created by:
         1. The use of "target" as a verb (example: "Target an unbowed Samurai.")23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 49/101
         2. The use of "target" as an adjective (example: "Bow the player's target Shugenja;"
         "Move a target Courtier home.")
         Previous instances of targeting are referred to, without creating a new targeting
         procedure, by:
         1. "Targeting" or "targeted" (example: "Negate an action targeting your Monk."; "If the
         action targeted your Ninja, straighten him;" "Bow the targeted Commander.")
         2. The use of "target" as a noun (example: "Straighten the target;" "Choose one of
         these targets.")
         TARGETING PARADOXES #
         If a cost or effect depends on a speciÒc targeting choice before it is actually made, the
         cost or effect instead constrains the targeting choice, so that it must target the thing
         mentioned if the effect is invoked, and cannot target the thing if the cost is not
         paid. Traits on cards in play that create extra costs for targeting something also create
         the opportunity to pay those costs.
         Example 1: "Actions on your Spells have Home if you target your Samurai with them." (Rae
         Sensei, Ivory Edition.) This trait creates a paradox because the determination of action
         legality involving Home takes place well before targeting in the action sequence. In practice,
         it means that 1. by the Good Faith Rule, you can only take an action during battle from
         your spell at home (unless it has Home by other means) if it can target your Samurai; 2. if
         you take advantage of the Home-granting trait, you must choose your Samurai to target
         with the Spell.
         Example 2: "Other players' actions targeting The Abbot cost 2 more Gold." (The Abbot, Exp.
         3, TNO) This trait creates a paradox because costs are paid before targeting. In practice,
         when the Abbot is in play, all actions that can target him may be taken with an additional
         Gold Cost of 2; if this is not paid they may not target The Abbot, and if the cost is paid the
         action must target him.
         PLAY OF THE GAME #
         TURNS AND TURN ORDER #
         A game of L5R is divided into turns. Beginning with the starting player, and continuing
         in turn order (that is, proceeding to the left), each player takes a turn.
         At any time after the start of the game, turn order starts with the active player and
         continues clockwise, to each player's left.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 50/101
         Whenever an effect asks "each player" to do something, the default is to start with the
         active player and continue once in turn order, skipping any players who are not
         eligible to do that thing.
         START OF GAME #
         After a game of L5R starts, follow steps A through F in sequence.
         A. All players show their Strongholds and Sensei (if any), and start with the Stronghold
         and any Sensei in play. Each player begins with his or her Family Honor stat at his or
         her Stronghold's Starting Honor, modiÒed by his or her Sensei.
         B. The starting player is the player with the highest Family Honor. If one or more
         players are tied in Family Honor, they decide who goes Òrst randomly, such as by
         rolling dice or Óipping a coin. The starting player uses the "going Òrst" side of his or
         her Stronghold, and the others turn their Stronghold to the "going second" side.
         C. All players shuÖe both their decks separately. Players should offer their decks to
         the other players for further shuÖing or cutting.
         D. Players place their decks and create four Provinces, then Òll each one from left to
         right with a card from the top of their Dynasty deck.
         E. All players draw Òve Fate cards simultaneously.
         F. Play begins; the starting player becomes the active player and takes a turn
         sequence (Action Phase through Dynasty Phase). When his or her turn has ended, the
         next player's turn, in turn order, begins, and he or she becomes the active player. This
         continues until one player has won the game, at which point the game ends
         immediately.
         When the starting player is determined, he or she is also considered the active player
         for purposes of things that happen before the Òrst turn begins.
         THE TURN SEQUENCE #
         0.0.1. Action Phase
         0.0.2. Attack Phase (optional)
         0.0.3. Dynasty Phase
         ACTION PHASE #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 51/101
         At the start of the Action Phase, the active player straightens all his or her bowed
         cards. Then, in any order, the active player turns all face-down cards in his or her
         Provinces face-up.
         In the Action Phase, players take an action round of Limited actions (for the active
         player only) and Open actions.
         The active player has the Òrst opportunity in the Action Phase to take a Limited or
         Open action, or pass. The other player then has a chance to take an Open action or
         pass.
         There are several Limited actions that players may take in the Action Phase (player
         abilities). Each of these has its own descriptive term. Other player abilities that depend
         on speciÒc keywords may be found in the alphabetical listing of game terms.
         CYCLE #
         Limited: If it is your Òrst turn, choose one or more face-up cards in your Provinces.
         Put them on the bottom of your deck in any order. Then (after reÒlling Provinces), turn
         all cards in your Provinces face-up.
         EQUIP #
         Repeatable Open, : Attach a target attachment card, with Gold Cost equal to the
         amount you paid, from your hand to your target Personality.
         Sometimes "Equip" is used as an effect in card text. This means that the effects of the
         Equip action are activated, and the card's Gold Cost is checked against the amount
         paid for the original action. If the original action did not give the opportunity to pay
         Gold, then before the card is attached, its Gold Cost must be paid or the attachment
         fails. The original action may modify any of the rules of the Equip procedure; for
         example, it may Equip a card "ignoring cost."
         Effects that merely "attach" a card do not invoke the Equip procedure or action.
         LOBBY #
         Political Limited: If you have higher Family Honor than each other player, bow your
         target unbowed Personality with 1 or more Personal Honor to take the Imperial Favor.
         Discarding the Favor is required for certain actions, including the two rulebook Favor
         player abilities:
         RULEBOOK FAVOR LIMITED #
         Favor Political Limited: Discard the Imperial Favor and a Fate card to draw a card.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 52/101
         ("Discard a card" is short for "Discard a Fate card from your hand.")
         RULEBOOK FAVOR BATTLE #
         Favor Political Battle: Discard the Imperial Favor to move a target attacking enemy
         Personality home.
         ATTACK PHASE #
         The active player may now optionally create ("declare") an Attack Phase. An Attack
         Phase has several segments in order.
         ATTACK PHASE SEQUENCE #
         Declaration Segment
         Maneuvers Segment
         Fight Battles
         DECLARATION SEGMENT #
         The player declaring the attack is the Attacker, and the other player is the Defender.
         The attack creates battleÒelds associated with each of the Defender's Provinces. One
         or more units on the same side of a battleÒeld make up an army.
         MANEUVERS SEGMENT #
         The Attacker Òrst simultaneously assigns any number of his or her unbowed
         Personalities from home to the attacking side at battleÒelds. The Attacker may assign
         Personalities to one battleÒeld or different battleÒelds, and may keep some or all of
         them home.
         Then the Defender assigns unbowed Personalities from home to the defending side at
         battleÒelds, in the same way.
         Assigning a Personality places it at that battleÒeld, and is different from "moving"
         between locations. A unit led by a bowed Personality may not be assigned.
         FIGHT BATTLES #
         The Attacker chooses a battleÒeld, and a battle is fought there. When that battle is
         over, the Attacker chooses a new battleÒeld where a battle has not yet been fought,
         and another battle is fought there. This repeats until all battleÒelds have been fought
         at.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 53/101
         Exactly one battle happens at each battleÒeld, even ones with no units. There is no
         further opportunity for a battle at a battleÒeld that has already been fought at, even if
         some units Ònd their way there.
         Once the last battle has ended, the Attack Phase ends. BattleÒelds cease to exist.
         Any units still at battleÒelds return home, and if they were attacking they bow.
         DYNASTY PHASE #
         In the Dynasty phase, the active player only takes Dynasty actions. The following
         player abilities are relevant.
         RECRUIT #
         Repeatable Dynasty, : Bring into play a target face-up Personality or Holding from
         your Province with Gold Cost equal to the amount you paid, paying 2 more Gold if the
         Personality has a Clan Alignment but does not have your Clan Alignment.
         If it is a Personality, the Recruiting player's Family Honor must additionally be equal to
         or higher than his Honor Requirement, if any, unless the player has lost Honor under
         certain circumstances. Then, the Recruited card is brought into play, bowed if it is a
         Holding. Personalities Recruited during a battle enter play in their controller's army at
         the current battleÒeld.
         Sometimes, as with Equip, "Recruit" is used as an effect in card text. This means that
         the effects of the Recruit action are activated, and the card's Gold Cost is checked
         against the amount paid for the original action. If the original action did not give the
         opportunity to pay Gold, then before the card enters play, its Gold Cost must be paid
         or the entering play fails. The original action may modify any of the rules of the Recruit
         procedure; for example, it may ask you to Recruit a card "from the discard pile."
         PROCLAIM #
         After a player announces a Recruit action or an action with Recruit as an effect, he or
         she may choose to Proclaim the Personality being recruited if he has the player's Clan
         Alignment and is being Recruited from a Province.
         A player may only Proclaim once per turn and only on his or her own turn.
         If Proclaiming is chosen, then after the Personality enters play, add the Personality's
         Personal Honor to the player's Family Honor.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 54/101
         Proclaiming gives the Proclaim keyword to the recruiting action. Honor gains from
         Proclaiming are from the rulebook Recruit action, or from the rulebook Recruit
         procedure if the action calling it was on a card.
         DYNASTY DISCARD #
         Repeatable Dynasty: Discard a face-up card from one of your Provinces.
         DRAWING AND DISCARDING FATE CARDS #
         At the end of the Dynasty Phase, that is, "at the end of the turn," the active player
         draws a Fate card. Then, if the active player has more Fate cards in hand than his or
         her maximum hand size, the player discards Fate cards until he or she has equal or
         fewer. Effects "before the turn ends" happen prior to this drawing and discarding.
         The other player now takes his or her turn.
         BATTLES #
         Most battles will happen as part of an Attack Phase, but some effects create battles
         separately.
         ACTIONS IN BATTLE #
         All actions taken during a battle - Battle actions, Engage actions, or even Interrupts
         during a battle — follow the additional rules of Presence and Location. (The rules of
         Presence and Location apply to all action types, including Interrupt and Engage).
         RULE OF PRESENCE #
         To legally take an action during battle, a player must control one or more units at the
         current battleÒeld. Actions with the Absent keyword are an exception.
         RULES OF LOCATION #
         0.1. To legally take an action from a card in a unit during battle, the unit
         must be at the current battleÒeld. Actions with the Home keyword are an
         exception.
         0.2. To be legally targeted by an action during battle, any cards in a unit
         must be at the current battleÒeld.
         0.3. When phrases such as "at two different locations" create an exception
         to the Rule of Location, the Rule should be followed as much as possible. In
         that case, "two different locations" should include the current battleÒeld
         and one other location.
         NO SECOND BATTLE RULE #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 55/101
         NO SECOND BATTLE RULE #
         A Personality who has already been in an attacking army during a battle resolution in
         the current Attack Phase will not move to a battleÒeld.
         BATTLE SEQUENCE #
         0.0.1. Engage Segment
         0.0.1. Combat Segment
         0.0.1. Resolution Segment
         0.0.1. After Resolution
         ENGAGE SEGMENT #
         Engage actions represent especially well-prepared or rapid maneuvers in battle. The
         Engage Segment is an action round of Engage actions, starting with the Defender.
         COMBAT SEGMENT #
         The Combat Segment is an action round of Battle actions, starting with the Defender.
         RESOLUTION SEGMENT #
         This segment is also known as "battle resolution."
         ARMY FORCE #
         An army's Force is the total of the Force of all unbowed Personalities and Followers in
         it. (Items modify their Personality's Force, bowed or unbowed.)
         BATTLE RESOLUTION #
         In the Resolution Segment, the Attacker and Defender total their armies' Force at the
         battleÒeld. A side with no units has zero Force.
         The side with the higher Force wins, and the side with the lower Force loses.
         If the Attacker wins, he or she destroys all units in the defending army. If the
         attacking army's Force was greater than the defending army's Force plus the Province
         Strength of the battleÒeld's Province, the Attacker also destroys the Province.
         When a Province is destroyed, discard any cards in it, and any Regions attached to it.
         Push together the other Provinces and the two decks to show the shrinking of their
         owner's lands.
         If the Defender wins, he or she destroys all units in the attacking army.
         If two armies have equal Force, the battle is a tie. If the battle is tied and there are
         one or more units on both sides of the battleÒeld, the Attacker and Defender each
         destroy all units in the enemy army. If the battle is tied on zero Force and either or
         both sides have no units, the battle has no outcome.
         The winner of a battle also gains Honor equal to twice the number of cards in the
         enemy army that were destroyed by resolution. If the battle was tied, each player
         gains Honor for destroying the other army.
         AFTER RESOLUTION #
         Then, the battle's resolution ends. In its aftermath, a number of things happen.
         0.1. All attacking units at that battleÒeld bow, then return home, as effects
         of battle resolution. This return after battle is not movement.
         0.2. If this is the last battle of the Attack Phase, or a battle created by other
         means, defending units return home (without bowing).
         0.3. Discard any Terrain cards at the battleÒeld.
         The battle itself then ends. Then, Òght any remaining battles. BattleÒelds cease to
         exist immediately before the Attack Phase ends, or if the battle was created by a card
         effect, immediately before the battle ends.
         SPECIAL WORDING RULES #
         Ambiguous wordings in the cards and rules of L5R follow rules of grammar that are
         more precise than ordinary language. These rules should not be used to force an
         unnatural reading onto a phrase; they are meant to clarify ambiguous usage only.
         Grammar rules for single words are found in the section, "SpeciÒc Game Terms and
         Procedures" under the entry for that word.
         PERSPECTIVE #
         A card's text (such as, "Lose 3 Honor" or "You may not take Political actions") is to be
         read from the perspective of its controller while the card is in play, and its owner while
         card is not. See also Possessive case.
         NUMBERS OF THINGS #
         When something checks for the presence of "a [thing]" or "any [things]," the check is
         met by one of those things even if the player in question has more than one in play.
         Example: "If you have a Samurai in play" is met if you have one, two or any higher number
         of Samurai in play.
         When something checks for the presence of a number of things, the check is also met
         by more than that number of those things.
         Example: If you have four Shugenja in play you meet the conditions "If you control two
         Shugenja" and "If you control a Shugenja."
         If the presence of an exact number of things is being checked for, this will be noted by
         language such as "exactly two" or "only one," or by mentioning two or more speciÒc
         numbers such as "zero or one."
         EXCEPTION: The wordings "once", "twice", "the third time", etc., mean exactly that
         number of times. If later occurrences are meant to count, wordings such as "third or
         later" will be used.
         The phrase "any number of" something includes zero.
         Example: "Bow any number of your Personalities" can be satisÒed by bowing zero
         Personalities.
         Something that allows a "second" use of an ability in a turn, etc., only allows the
         second use of the ability that turn. Multiple effects that allow second uses do not
         allow the ability to be used three or more times.
         CONJUNCTIONS #
         Conjunctions are connecting words. These rules cover usage of the conjunctions "and"
         and "or."
         The phrase "a [keyword 1] and a [keyword 2]" refers to two different cards, each with
         the relevant keyword.
         Example: "Bow a Samurai and a Courtier" is not fulÒlled by bowing a single card with both
         Samurai and Courtier as keywords.
         Modifying words and phrases appearing before or behind a phrase in the form of "a
         [modiÒer] X or Y" or "a X and Y [modiÒer]" modify both things in that phrase.
         Example: "A Shadowlands Shugenja or Monk" means "a Shadowlands Shugenja or a
         Shadowlands Monk." If "a Monk or a Shadowlands Shugenja" is meant, it will be written
         that way. Likewise, "a Shugenja or Monk without attachments" means "a Shugenja without
         attachments or a Monk without attachments."
         Conditions are treated like modiÒers; they also carry through to both clauses
         separated only by a conjunction.
         Example: "If Ono is honorable, gain 2 Honor or give him +2F" means he must be honorable
         to activate either of those effects.
         ModiÒers attached to a phrase in the form of "a [modiÒer] X or a Y" modify only the
         Òrst thing in the phrase; they do not carry over the "a."
         Example: "A Shadowlands Shugenja or a Monk" does not imply that the Monk has to be
         Shadowlands.
         Effects that check for a condition phrased as "X or Y" are also satisÒed if both X and Y
         are met.
         Example: "Destroyed during a duel or a battle" would apply even if the duel was during a
         battle, and "target a Samurai or Shugenja" could target one Personality with both
         keywords.
         PRONOUNS #
         Pronouns and pronoun-like terms, like "him or her," "it," "them," or "that Personality,"
         refer to the last possible thing mentioned in the text that the term would logically
         refer to.
         Examples:
         A. "Target a Samurai and a Shugenja. Bow him." "Him" would refer to the Shugenja.
         B. "Target one of your Personalities: Bow a target Personality opposing him." "him"
         would refer to your Personality, as a Personality cannot oppose himself.
         C.
         "Target a Personality and an Item. Give him +2F". "Him" refers to the Personality because
         an Item would be referred to as "it."
         Pronouns referring to "each" of a number of players refer separately to each of those
         players.
         Example: "Target another player. Each of you discards a card from his hand." "His" in this
         example refers to the other player discarding from his own hand, and you discarding from
         your own hand.
         POSSESSIVE CASE #
         The possessive case - terms such as "your," "his" or "a player's" - is used in a number
         of different ways.
         When referring to the relationship between a player and a card or cards, possessive
         terms refer to a card in play controlled by the player, or a card out of play owned by
         the player.
         Attached and attaching cards in a unit refer to each other with the possessive case.
         Example: A Follower's Personality is the Personality it is attached to, and a Personality's
         Followers are those attached to him.
         Possessive case referring to a unit's cards indicates cards in that unit.
         Example: "The unit's Personality" or "the unit's Followers."
         Possessive case can also refer to a card's stats, traits, or abilities.
         Example: "His Chi," "its abilities."
         When referring to actions (as distinct from abilities), the possessive case refers to the
         player who took the action, regardless of the owner or controller of a card it is on.
         Example: If a player is able to take an action from an ability on one of your cards, the
         effects come from that player's action, but come from your cards and are your card effects.
         REFERENCES #
         A card's text can refer to itself or other cards in a number of ways.
         Most simply, references to "this card" or "this (card type)" refer to the card itself.
         Restrictions in a card's traits that don't explicitly refer to anything are understood to
         refer to the card itself.
         Example: "Will only attach to a Samurai" should be read as "This card will only attach to a
         Samurai."
         References on a card to the card's own title or to a shortened form of the title in the
         case of Personalities (such as "Kei" as short for "Mirumoto Kei"), refer to the card itself.
         Such references by title refer only to that copy of the card, not to any other copy that
         might exist, unless they use wording such as "a Mirumoto Kei" or "a copy of Mirumoto
         Kei."
         Attachments with triggered traits or actions referring to "this Personality" refer to the
         Personality the card was attached to at the time when the trait was triggered or the
         action taken. Ongoing effects of such traits or actions do not change their reference if
         the attachment is later transferred.
         Example: if you use an Item's ability "Limited: This Personality has Tactician until the end of
         the game" and later transfer the Item to another Personality, the original Personality still
         keeps Tactician, and the new one does not gain it until you use the ability again.
         "This" before a keyword (for example, "this Shugenja") refers to the Personality in the
         attachment's unit, even if the Personality has lost or otherwise does not have that
         keyword.
         Example: An effect on a Spell that says "Bow this Shugenja" still bows its Personality when
         he or she has lost the Shugenja keyword.
         An attachment referring to "this Personality" in a triggered trait or action refer to the
         Personality the card was attached to when the trait was triggered or the action taken.
         Effects of such traits or actions do not change their reference if the attachment is later
         transferred.
         "This unit" refers to the card's unit.
         "This battle" refers to the current battle.
         "This battleÒeld" refers to the current battleÒeld.
         "This card" refers to the card itself.
         "This Province" on an Event refers to the Province the Event is in.
         "This Province" on a FortiÒcation refers to the Province it is attached to.
         "This Province" on any other card refers to the current battleÒeld's Province.
         Other uses of "this" follow normal language, such as "this turn."23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 61/101
         Example: An item with the cost "Bow this Shugenja" cannot have the cost paid by a nonShugenja personality.
         In triggers that involve a card leaving play, references to an in-play state of the card,
         such as its unit or location, refer to the state of the card before it left play.
         REFERENCES USING REPEATED TERMS #
         Once a card or other game element is identiÒed by a keyword in a trait or action's text
         (such as, "Bow one of your Samurai") further references to that keyword within that
         trait or action are meant to only identify the particular game element clearly (such as,
         "Your Samurai gains +2F"). SpeciÒcally, if the Samurai somehow loses the Samurai
         keyword between the Òrst and second references, the second effect still applies.
         References to a game element that mention what happened to it in previous effects or
         costs of the same action or trait (such as "the discarded card" or "the Samurai you
         bowed") should also be treated this way - as a reference to the particular element
         intended, rather than a requirement that the thing actually happened. When one
         thing is truly conditional on the other, it will be stated explicitly.
         Example: In "Target two of your Samurai and bow one of them: Give +3F to the one who did
         not bow and give a +1F token to the one who bowed," if the second Samurai pays the cost
         in some other way than bowing, he still gets the token. However, if the same effect ends "…
         attach a +1F token to the other Samurai if he bowed," the Samurai who paid the cost in a
         different way does not get the token.
         REFERENCES TO OTHER POINTS IN TIME #
         References involving a game state in the context of a past occurrence check the game
         state only at the time of the occurrence.
         Example: The rules for rehonoring say a Personality is rehonored, "Before a player gains
         Honor from an action or trait that targeted or came from one or more of his or her
         dishonorable Personalities…" Dishonorable status is checked only at the time the targeting,
         origin or performing of the action or trait is established.
         BLIND CARDS RULE #
         When a rule or card text needs to know what an action does or will do, it only takes
         into account the current text of the action. It does not consider any continuous,
         ongoing or triggered effects that change the action's effects or cause them to fail.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 62/101
         Example: "Search your deck for a Strategy card with a challenge as one of its effects." Even
         if the condition "Challenges do not happen" is in effect, you may search your deck for such
         a card because of the blind cards rule.
         This rule should not be applied to retrospective knowledge of whether an action
         actually did something.
         The blind cards principle should not be over-applied beyond the speciÒc case of of a
         game element needing to check what an action does.
         COMPARING STATS #
         If an action compares one stat to another without specifying one of the stats being
         compared, the card last referred to is meant. If there is no appropriate last reference,
         then the card the action is on is meant.
         Example 1: "Target a Samurai and a Personality opposing him with lower Chi" means
         "lower Chi than the targeted Samurai."
         Example 2: "Target an enemy Personality with lower Force" on a Follower checks the
         target's Force against the Force of the Follower itself.
         SPECIFIC GAME TERMS AND PROCEDURES #
         In alphabetical order, this section lists rules associated with speciÒc terms and
         keywords that have not been mentioned so far. It also serves as an index of terms
         that are described in the main rules, with links to their deÒnition there.
         ABILITY
         Text on a card, rules or player that produces an action.
         ABSENT #
         An ability with the Absent keyword may be used during battle even if its player
         controls no units at the current battleÒeld.
         ACTION
         A procedure that creates effects and may have costs or other requirements.
         ACTION PHASE
         The Òrst phase of the game.
         ACTION ROUND23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 63/101
         ACTION ROUND
         A procedure for players taking actions.
         ACTIVE PLAYER #
         The player whose turn it is.
         ADDITIONAL ACTION #
         Additional actions granted by effects are taken after the current action resolves. In
         effect, they allow their player to take another action in the present action round
         without opponents getting an action.
         If the type of additional action is not speciÒed, it is the type appropriate to the current
         action round - Limited in the player's own Action Phase, Open in any Action Phase,
         Engage in the Engage Segment and Battle in the Combat Segment.
         If, at his or her additional opportunity to act, a player chooses to pass rather than
         taking an action, this does not count towards ending the Action Round.
         ADDITIONAL PHASE OR SEGMENT #
         Some effects grant an "additional" phase or segment within the sequence of play. By
         default, it occurs once the action or trait that granted it has ended, regardless of what
         phase or segment the sequence of play is currently in.
         ADDITIONAL USE #
         Some effects grant an additional time an ability or trait can be used in a period of time
         (for example, "an additional time per turn"). This additional time also applies to any
         period of time greater than the one granted.
         Example: An ability that can be used "one additional time this battle" can also be used once
         during the battle even if it was restricted to once per turn or once per game.
         The stated period of time also means the original ability's Òrst use must be taken
         within that period in order to gain an additional use.
         Example: If a "once per game" effect can be used "one additional time this turn," Tte player
         must take the use with the "once per game" limitation during this turn, otherwise there is
         no additional use.

         A term used in the multiplayer rules.

         See Conjunctions.
         ANNOUNCE #
         See Actions.
         ANOTHER #
         "Another" usually refers to a card, player or other thing in the game that is different
         from the card, player, etc., in question.
         "Another" should not be taken as a restriction on the keywords or other
         characteristics of the source of an effect, cost or targeting.
         Example: If a Lion Clan Personality, Matsu Ichi, has the text "Target another Lion Clan
         Personality," the targeting is legal even if Matsu Ichi loses the Lion Clan keyword.
         ARMOR #
         A keyword found on some Items. A Personality cannot attach more than one Armor.
         ARMY #
         One or more units in a given side at a battleÒeld.
         A side with no units is not an army and has no Force total. If text refers only to "your
         army" it means "your army at the current battleÒeld."
         When "army" is used to refer to a side of a battle that units are being moved to,
         assigned to, entering play in, or created in, this does not imply that an army must
         already exist there; the location may have no units to begin with, as an army is being
         brought into existence there.
         ASSIGN #
         A non-movement way to change the location of one or more units from home to a
         battleÒeld. See Maneuvers Phase.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 65/101
         References to assigning a Personality should be taken to mean assigning the
         Personality's unit. Likewise, when a player assigns a unit, the unit can also be said to
         assign.
         In effects that allow a player to just assign a unit, that player may normally only assign
         units he or she controls. Some effects, however, may explicitly allow the player to
         assign other players' units.
         Whether a unit assigns to the defending or attacking army depends on who controls
         the unit, not necessarily who assigns it.
         Example: If the Attacker is allowed to assign one of the Defender's units he or she does not
         control, he or she must normally still assign it to the defending army.
         The choice of assignment refers to which one of several battleÒelds a unit is assigned
         but not the choice to have a unit assign or stay at home.
         Example: If player A "may assign" one of player B's units, player A does not have the option
         to make player B's unit stay at home instead of assign. In the case of the optional "may
         assign," player A's options are either to assign the unit to a battleÒeld, or to let player B
         have the option to assign it or not.
         For purposes of knowing which player actually assigns a unit, it is the player who
         chooses where it assigns to.
         ATTACH #
         To put an attachment on a Personality. See Attachments andEquip.
         ATTACHMENT #
         A card type that attaches to a Personality. See Attachments.

         A state of a card, marked by turning it 90 degrees to the right. See Bowed and
         unbowed.
         CAVALRY #
         The Cavalry keyword is relevant to the following player ability which all players have:
         Absent Engage: Target your unbowed Personality in a Cavalry unit at any location.
         Move it to the current battleÒeld.
         Note that a "Cavalry unit" is one in which the Personality and all Followers, if any, have
         the Cavalry keyword (see Unit keywords).
         CANNOT #
         "Cannot" or "can not" mean that a type of effect is prevented.
         CAST #
         When a player takes an action from a Spell attached to a Personality (usually a
         Shugenja) the Personality with the Spell attached "casts" the Spell and is the "caster."
         CHALLENGE #
         A challenge is an effect that creates a duel between two Personalities. One Personality
         will be the challenger, and the other will be the challenged; they must be controlled by
         different players. "A duels B" is shorthand for "A issues a challenge to B." The
         Personalities' players can also be referred to as "challenger" and "challenged"
         respectively.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 67/101
         Some challenges will offer the opportunity to be refused. If the challenged
         Personality's player chooses to refuse the duel, then the duel doesn't happen. There
         may be consequences of refusing. Otherwise, the challenged player accepts, and the
         two Personalities enter a duel.
         A challenge will not happen if its two Personalities are controlled by the same player,
         or if either card in the duel is not a Personality.
         If a Personality involved in a challenge or duel leaves play during it, the challenge or
         duel ends immediately without resolution. In particular, Focus Effects that have not
         yet resolved at that point do not resolve at all.
         Effects may substitute one Personality for another in a challenge or duel. This does
         not change the original targeting of the challenge. The new Personality carries out the
         remaining steps instead of the original one, goes through resolution and takes the
         consequences of winning or losing.
         CHI
         A stat on a Personality, which can be modiÒed by a stat on Items.
         CHI DEATH
         The rule that a Personality with 0 Chi is destroyed.
         CLAN ALIGNMENT
         Which of the factions of L5R a Stronghold, player or Personality belongs to. See also
         Stronghold and Personality. For rules on the same and different Clan alignment, see
         Different and same keywords.
         COMBAT SEGMENT
         The segment of a battle in which Battle actions are taken.
         COMBINING #
         A way to use similar actions from cards in the same unit to create a larger strength
         effect. Fear effects, Ranged Attacks, and Melee Attacks can each be combined, but
         only with other effects of the same kind (that is, Ranged and Melee Attacks cannot
         combine with each other, etc.)
         To explain this rule we'll use the term "attack effect" and "kind of effect" to refer to the
         particular effect being combined, whether Fear, Ranged or Melee.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 68/101
         Combining starts with an original action that creates an attack effect from a card in a
         unit. As an Interrupt to that action, the player may use an ability from another card in
         the same unit that is appropriate to the phase and that creates another attack effect
         of the same kind. The player pays that ability's costs, then resolves its action's effects,
         with one change: instead of creating a separate attack effect, each of those actions'
         relevant attack effects adds its own strength (with any modiÒcations) to the strength
         of the original attack effect.
         The original attack effect may only target a card that it, as well as each of the
         combining actions, could target. All other characteristics of the attack effect come
         from the original. You may combine more than one attack effect with the same initial
         action.
         Because only the original effect actually targets the card, a reduction or increase to
         the effect's strength that depends on a particular card being targeted only reduced
         the total combined attack (for example, "Ranged Attacks targeting this card have -2
         strength"). However, an effect that reduces or increases all attack effects will change
         the strengths of the combining effects before they are added together ("Ranged
         Attacks from cards at this battleÒeld have -2 strength).
         COMPARE #
         A term used in Fear effects, Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks.
         CONQUEROR #
         Cards in a Conqueror Personality's unit do not bow prior to returning home after a
         battle's resolution.
         CONTINUOUS
         A kind of trait that has no Òxed duration.
         CONTRIBUTE #
         A Personality or Follower contributes Force when its Force is added into its army's
         total Force. This is part of a battle's resolution, but can also happen when an army's
         total Force is calculated for other reasons.
         CONTROL #
         A game state relating cards to players; see [[#Card-control|.

         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 69/101
         COPY #
         Some effects may copy a keyword, trait, or stat from one card to another. If a stat is
         copied, set the copying card's stat to the current value of the copied card's stat.
         Copied abilities can be used regardless of whether the original has been used.
         References to the original ability's card become references to the copying card in the
         copied ability.
         A card will not copy its own text or stats.
         For "creates a copy" see Created cards.
         COST
         A condition of taking an action or using a trait that requires paying Gold or bowing the
         card itself. See Costs, and Paying Gold.
         COURAGE #
         All players have the following ability relevant to the Courage keyword.
         Repeatable Courage Interrupt: Discard a Courage card from your hand to give one
         of the action's Fear effects either +2 or-2 strength.
         CREATED CARDS #
         Some effects may create cards in addition to the cards included in decks. You may use
         pieces of paper, face-down spare cards, or other objects to keep track of these.
         OÕcial proxies for created cards may sometimes be included in L5R booster packs.
         Creating a card is an instantaneous effect with no duration. The printed text and stats
         of a created card are determined by the effect that created it. If an effect that creates
         a card gives no value for a stat the card type normally has, that stat's base value is
         zero. EXCEPTION: Created Personalities have a "-" Honor Requirement.
         Created attachments attach to a Personality as part of their creation effect. Other
         cards a player create enter play in his or her home; cards created during a battle join
         his or her current army, attaching to a Personality if necessary. A created card enters
         play without being Recruited or Equipped (so for example, a player cannot Proclaim
         it.)
         When a created card leaves play, it ceases to exist. A created card that fails to enter
         play never exists. If a sequence of effects from the same action or trait Òrst puts a
         created card out of play, and subsequently refers to any aspect of that card, the state
         of the created card just before it left play is checked.

         CREATING A COPY #
         If an effect "creates a copy" of a card, it creates a copy of the printed card without
         copying any effects, attachments or tokens on the original.

         DECLARATION SEGMENT #
         The Òrst segment of the Attack Phase. See Declaration Segment.
         DEFEND #
         To assign to, move to, or enter play in a defending army. Units and cards on the
         defending side, and a player with units on the defending side, can all be classed as
         "defending."
         DEFENDER #
         The player being attacked in an Attack Phase or battle.
         DELAYED #
         An effect that is not applied immediately after it is activated, due to its own text or
         another effect. See Delayed effects.
         DESTINED #
         After a player's card with the Destined keyword enters play, he or she draws a Fate
         card.
         DESIGNATOR #
         Boldface text such as "Open:" in an ability, that determines when its action may be
         taken. See Abilities.
         DESTROY #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 71/101
         DESTROY #
         0.0.1. To remove a card from play through an effect that speciÒcally
         destroys it (as opposed to discarding, removing from the game, etc.)
         Destroyed cards normally go to their appropriate discard pile; see Discard
         piles.
         0.0.2. To eliminate a Province; see Provinces.
         DIE #
         To be destroyed.
         DIFFERENT #
         For rules on when cards have different keywords or Clan Alignments see here. For the
         Rule of Location and "different locations," see here.
         DISCARD #
         0.0.1. To put a card into its discard pile. An effect that instructs the player
         only to "discard a card" or "discard [a number of] cards" is shorthand for
         discarding Fate cards from his or her hand. References to discarding a card
         that do not create a discard effect should be read more generally.
         0.0.2. To return the Imperial Favor to the uncontrolled state. See Imperial
         Favor, p. 53.
         0.0.3. Related: A player ability allowing discard of cards from Provinces
         ("Dynasty Discard").
         0.0.4. Related: A procedure at the end of the turn discarding cards down to
         the maximum hand size.
         DISCARDED #
         Used as an adjective, the state of a card that is in a discard pile and is not dead.
         DISCARD PILES
         Areas where discarded cards go, one for Dynasty and one for Fate.
         DISCIPLINE #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 72/101
         A special trait that consists of the word "Discipline" and a Gold cost icon. Players may
         play a card with Discipline from their own discard pile for one of its action, paying the
         Gold cost in the icon as an additional cost of the action, or adding the Gold cost to the
         action's if it already has a Gold cost. Then, after that action ends, remove the card
         from the game.
         Discipline Strategies that put themselves into play (for example, Terrains) are instead
         removed from the game when they next leave play.
         DISHONOR, DISHONORABLE, DISHONORABLY DEAD
         A condition of Personalities indicating disgrace.
         DISHONOR VICTORY
         To win by reducing the last other player to -20 Honor or below.
         DO NOT #
         "Do not" or "does not" in a card effect mean that another effect is prevented.
         DRAW #
         For a player to put the top card of his or her Fate deck into his or her hand. This
         normally happens at the end of turn.
         Effects that happen to put the top card of the deck into a player's hand without saying
         "draw" are not considered drawing - for example, when a player looks at the top four
         cards of her deck, and chooses to put into hand the one that happened to be on top.
         Effects that draw more than one card at the same time (such as, "Draw 3 cards") occur
         simultaneously, unless they say otherwise (such as, "Draw 3 cards consecutively").
         DUEL #
         A duel is a confrontation that comes from a challenge between two Personalities, who
         must be controlled by different players.
         Follow these steps in a duel:
         0.0.1. Each player has a focusing area created for that duel.
         0.0.2. The challenged player has the Òrst option to focus or strike; if "A
         duels B," then B's player is the challenged.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 73/101
         0.0.3. To focus, a player either chooses a card from his or her hand, or
         takes the top card of his or her Fate deck without looking at it, and
         puts it face-down in a special focused cards area. Focusing is not
         "playing" the card.
         0.0.4. If one player focused, the other player then chooses to focus or
         strike.
         0.0.5. The players continue to take turns focusing until one of them
         chooses to strike. A player who can't focus must strike.
         0.0.6. A player who has focused four times may not focus any more in
         that duel.
         0.0.7. Once a strike has been called, turn all focused cards face-up.
         0.0.8. Any traits on focused cards with the special trigger "As a Focus
         Effect:" resolve. The player whose turn it is chooses the order. Ignore any
         other text on focused cards.
         0.0.9. Duel resolution. The duel now resolves.
         0.0.10. Each player totals the Focus Values of his or her focused cards,
         and adds his or her Personality's duel stat to this total. The duel stat is
         Chi unless another stat is given; for example, a "duel of Force" is one
         in which both Personalities use Force instead of Chi as their duel stat.
         0.0.11. The higher total wins the duel, and the lower total loses.
         0.0.12. If the two totals are tied, both players lose and take the loser's
         consequences.
         The duel ends when this duel resolution step ends.
         Further effects from the duel or other cards may give consequences for the loser or
         winner. Apply these consequences now.
         Consequences that alter who wins or loses the duel are applied Òrst, in an order
         chosen by the active player. If an effect directly makes one Personality win the duel,
         this makes the other Personality lose, unless another effect alters the other
         Personality's outcome. Likewise, if an effect directly makes one Personality lose the
         duel, this makes the other Personality win, unless another effect alters that
         Personality's outcome. If outcome-altering effects apply to both Personalities, this
         means that both of them can win or lose.
         Then all other consequences are applied, again in an order chosen by the active
         player.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 74/101
         Discard all focused cards and end all changes to their Focus Value.
         DUELIST #
         If a Personality in a duel has the Duelist keyword then, if scores are tied in the duel's
         resolution, and the other Personality is not a Duelist, the Duelist wins.
         DUEL STAT #
         The stat compared in a duel, which is Chi by default.
         If more than one effect changes which stat is used in a duel, Òrst apply effects from
         the action or trait that created the duel, then apply effects from other sources which
         override the stats speciÒed in the duel, in the order they were applied. See Timing.
         DYNASTY ACTION
         A type of action taken in the Dynasty Phase.
         DYNASTY PHASE
         A phase of the game in which, among other things, Dynasty cards can be brought into
         play.
         ELEMENT KEYWORD #
         One of the Òve keywords for the mystic elements of Rokugan: Air, Earth, Fire, Water,
         and Void.
         "Thunder" and "Jade" are not element keywords.
         ENEMY #
         Referring to the player on the opposing side to the player of reference during a battle
         (also, the "enemy leader"), and to cards in units he or she controls. Cards not in units,
         such as Holdings or Terrains, are not "enemy cards."
         ENGAGE ACTIONS
         A type of action taken in battle.
         ENGAGE SEGMENT
         The segment prior to a battle's Combat Segment when Engage actions may be taken.
         ENLIGHTENMENT VICTORY, ENLIGHTEN23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 75/101
         ENLIGHTENMENT VICTORY, ENLIGHTEN
         Winning the game by having all Òve Rings in play.
         ENTER
         To go into an area of the game.
         ENTERING-PLAY #
         An entering-play effect is one that is triggered by a card entering play.
         The phrase "ignoring entering-play effects," referring to cards entering play, means
         that all effects dependent on the trigger of those cards entering play are prevented.
         EQUIP
         An ability and procedure for bringing attachments into play.
         EVENT
         A type of Dynasty card.
         EVEN IF #
         The phrase "Even if" is a permission. The phrase "Even if" followed by a condition
         means that something can happen in spite of a rule that says it can't happen while
         that condition is true. It only supersedes rulebook rules, not card effects. For example,
         "Assign him, even if bowed" overrides the limitation that bowed cards cannot assign.
         EXCHANGE #
         When an effect exchanges two stats, note their current values. Then, simultaneously
         set each stat to the noted value of the other one.
         EXPENDABLE #
         After a card with the Expendable keyword is destroyed, the player who controlled it
         draws a card. "Expendable" status is checked just before being destroyed.
         EXPENSIVE #
         A card with a higher Gold Cost stat relative to another is more expensive.
         EXPERIENCED #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 76/101
         Some Personality cards have the Experienced keyword, which is sometimes followed
         by a number representing the Personality's experience level. A Personality with
         Experienced and no number has experience level of one. A Personality without
         Experienced has experience level zero.
         Any number of single Personalities with the same title but different experience levels
         may be included in a deck.
         During the Dynasty Phase, a player may bring an Experienced Personality into play
         normally, or may overlay him onto one of his or her Personalities in play with the
         same title but lower experience level. When overlaying, a player does not need to
         meet Honor Requirements or pay costs, but does need to meet other requirements
         and restrictions, including Loyal.
         An overlaying card replaces its less experienced version without entering play, and the
         less experienced card is removed from the game without leaving play. On overlaying,
         the new card keeps all states, ongoing effects, attachments, and tokens of the old
         card, and is considered to be the same card. Overlaying is not Recruiting.
         Experienced cards that are not Personalities follow the Experienced deck construction
         rules, but do not overlay.
         Some cards released in the Coils of Madness expansion have the "Experienced CoM"
         keyword. These may overlay a non-Experienced version as usual, but may not be
         overlaid by a higher level version.
         FACE UP, FACE DOWN
         Game states that cards can be in. When used as an adjective, they are hyphenated.
         FACING #
         A Personality is "facing" another player's Personality in a duel while both are involved
         in the same duel.
         FAMILY HONOR
         A player's Honor score.
         FAMILY NAME #
         The family name is part of the title of some Personalities. Some families are aÕliated
         with Clans; others are not.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 77/101
         Typically, a Personality's family name will be the Òrst word in a two-word non-English
         name. However, the list of names in Appendix A is the Ònal authority. If any of the
         words in the lists (other than the Clan Alignments) appear in a Personality's title, that
         is his or her family name.
         Example: The Personality Naka Mahatsu does not have the family name Naka, because it
         does not appear in the lists. (In the setting, "Naka" is an honoriÒc title, not a family name.)
         Alternate titles from an Experienced or Inexperienced keyword do not give their family
         names to the card.
         FAIL #
         When a cost or effect is activated by the game text but does not happen, it fails. This
         can be because of prevention or lack of suitable object (for example, "Bow an
         unbowed Shugenja" when no Shugenja are in the game).
         Fate: A deck in the game and the type of cards that go in it.
         FAVOR ABILITIES #
         Player abilities granted by the rules that require discarding the Imperial Favor, known
         as Rulebook Favor Limited and Rulebook Favor Battle.
         FEAR #
         A Fear effect has a numerical strength (example: Fear 4). "Fear X" is shorthand for the
         effect "Target an enemy Follower or Personality without Followers and bow it if its
         Force is equal to or lower than X." Fear effects from cards in the same unit can be
         combined with each other in the same way as Ranged and Melee attacks can.
         FOCUS, FOCUS EFFECT
         Terms used in duels.
         FOLLOWER
         A type of attachment.
         FOR #
         An effect that depends on another effect or occurrence is indicated by "for" wording.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 78/101
         Example: An Honor loss "for" losing a duel is any Honor loss from any source that is
         speciÒcally contingent on losing a duel, be it an effect of the duel itself, a triggered trait, or
         something else.
         "For" wording only refers to a speciÒcally named consequence of the effect, not to a
         consequence arising from a chain of contingent effects.
         Example: In the case above, if a dishonorable Personality is destroyed for losing a duel, and
         his controller loses Honor, this is not an Honor loss "for" losing the duel, but an Honor loss
         for dying.
         FOR EACH #
         The term "for each", such as "Gain 1 Honor for each Samurai you control," creates a
         single effect rather than numerous separate effects. In this instance, a player
         controlling 3 Samurai would gain 3 Honor at once, not 1 Honor three separate times.
         Sometimes "for each" refers back to effects in the same action or trait. In this
         particular wording, only the actual occurrences created by the Òrst effect count
         toward the second, not effects triggered by other cards or rules.
         Example: "Destroy 1 to 3 enemy cards. Gain 1 Honor for each card destroyed." If the
         destruction of one enemy card triggers the destruction of another (as when a Personality's
         attachments are destroyed via the rules), the additional card is not counted towards the
         Honor. Also note that if the destruction of one enemy card is prevented, one less Honor will
         be gained.
         FORTIFICATION #
         When brought into play, Holdings with the FortiÒcation keyword are attached to the
         Province they entered play from, or to any of their player's Provinces if they were not
         brought in from a Province. Such Holding cards are kept under the card in the
         Province (if any), in the same way an attachment is kept under its Personality.
         FortiÒcations are Recruited as normal, and enter play bowed. They are destroyed if
         the Province is destroyed. During a battle, abilities on a FortiÒcation can only be used
         if the FortiÒcation is attached to the current battleÒeld's Province.
         FROM #
         Some things check to see if other effects, actions, or targeting come "from" a given
         source. The source is the card that the effect, action or targeting is printed on, or the
         rulebook if it is printed there.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 79/101
         Examples: Destruction from Chi death is from the rulebook. Honor gains from Proclaiming
         are from the rulebook.
         If a card effect creates a procedure, effects written in the rulebook that are part of the
         procedure come from the rulebook.
         Example: An action on a card creates a battle. Returning home and bowing after the battle
         is a rulebook effect, rather than action or card effect, because the procedure that includes
         the returning home and bowing is described in the rulebook.
         There are two exceptions:
         •Targeting and effects of Fear effects, Ranged Attacks and Melee Attacks come from
         the card that created the Fear, Ranged Attack or Melee Attack, not the rulebook.
         •Effects of traits and abilities given to other cards, copied from other cards, or on
         created cards, come from the card they are on.
         GOLD COST #
         A stat found on many cards; also, as "Gold cost," the amount that must be paid for an
         action, including Equip or Recruit, which both relate to the Gold Cost of the card
         entering play. See Costs, and see Personalities for special rules about their Gold Costs.
         GOLD PRODUCTION #
         A stat on a Stronghold or a Holding that can be changed by effects.
         GOOD FAITH
         A rule that prevents actions from being taken if their costs or some conditions cannot
         be met.
         HAND
         Fate cards held by a player.
         HIGHER THAN
         See Comparing Stats.
         HOME KEYWORD #
         An ability with the Home keyword may be used during battle even if the card it is on is
         at home.
         HONOR #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 80/101
         HONOR #
         Short for Family Honor. See also Honor gains and losses.
         HONORABLE #
         A Personality not in the dishonorable state. See Dishonor.
         "Honorably dead" refers to such a Personality who is dead.
         HONOR REQUIREMENT
         A stat on Personalities.
         HONOR VICTORY
         To win by reaching 40 Honor.
         HUMAN #
         This term refers to a Personality or Follower who does not have the Nonhuman
         keyword. It is not itself a keyword.
         IGNORE #
         When a cost, effect or requirement is ignored, it is no longer a cost, effect or
         requirement of that thing.
         IMPERIAL FAVOR #
         An object in the game representing political graces. It must be supplied by the players.
         The Imperial Favor is only controlled by one player at a time. It starts the game
         uncontrolled. When a player controls the Favor and discards it, it becomes
         uncontrolled.
         "Discard the Imperial Favor to …" may be required as part of an effect sequence; in
         this case, discarding the Favor can happen only if you control it. Effects that discard
         the Favor otherwise do not require you to control it.
         Changes to control of the Favor are instantaneous.
         The Favor is not a card, though it may be represented by one. The default abilities
         associated with the Favor are not actually on the Favor, but on the player.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 81/101
         A player who controls the Favor keeps it in his or her home, regardless of the means
         used to represent it.
         The Lobby, Favor Limited and Favor Battle player abilities also relate to the Imperial
         Favor.
         IN PLAY
         A state of a card.
         INCREASE
         See Reduction.
         INDEFINITE CONDITIONAL EFFECT
         An effect triggered in the future whenever something happens.
         INFANTRY #
         This term refers to a Personality or Follower who does not have the Cavalry keyword.
         It is not itself a keyword. An "Infantry unit" is one in which at least one Personality
         or Follower does not have the Cavalry keyword (see Unit keywords).
         INSTANTANEOUS
         A type of effect that happens and is over with, having no duration.
         INSTEAD
         See Substitution.
         INTERRUPT
         A type of action played during another action.
         INVEST #
         This is a trait that starts with "Invest" and a Gold cost (for example, "Invest :").
         Before paying for a card entering play, a player may permanently increase the card's
         Gold Cost by the additional cost in its Invest trait, once, to get an additional effect after
         it enters play (for example, "Gain 1 Honor" or "Give this card a +2F token.") When
         Invest appears on a non-Strategy card, its effects come from the Invest trait, not the
         action that brought the card into play.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 82/101
         An Invest cost on a Strategy may be added to the cost of any action the player is
         taking from the Strategy, at the point when that cost would be paid. If it creates
         distinct effects, as opposed to just modifying the action, they are added to the action's
         effects, resolving last, and become part of the action. Things that can pay for an action
         on a Strategy can also pay for an Invest cost on a Strategy.
         ITEM
         A type of attachment.
         JOIN #
         To come under a player's control, whether by entering play or changing controller.
         KENSAI #
         A Kensai Personality can attach two Weapons if neither of them is Two-handed.
         KEYWORD
         A word at the top of a card's text box, or in boldface in an ability. For ability keywords,
         see here. To deal with effects that count keywords, see here.
         KHARMIC #
         A keyword that can appear on Dynasty or Fate cards.
         Players have the following ability relevant to Kharmic cards:

         Normally, eight.
         MAY NOT #
         See Prevention.
         MAY REMAIN BOWED #
         This phrase refers to a card. It means that a card's controller may choose to prevent
         its straightening before each time it straightens. The "may remain bowed" effect lasts
         until the next time the card actually does straighten. See also Remain.
         MELEE ATTACK #

         "Move to attack" means to use movement to enter an attacking army, and "move to
         defend means to use movement to enter a defending army.
         MULTIPLAYER #
         A keyword indicating that a card is most useful (or only useful) in a multiplayer game.

         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 85/101
         NAVAL #
         Players have the following ability relevant to Naval cards, known as Naval Invasion:
         NAVAL INVASION #
         Engage: If you are the Attacker, you have the Òrst opportunity to take a Battle action,
         which must come from a card in a Naval Personality's unit. Passing that action does
         not count toward ending the action round.
         NEED NOT #
         This phrase, "need not X", means that the card's player can optionally have an effect
         (X) not happen, but later effects within the same action or trait proceed as if the effect
         had happened. This also means that even if the effect X fails, the later effects proceed
         as if the effect had happened.
         ''Example: When taking the action "'''Kiho Open:''' Bow your target Monk to draw a
         card," if its player's Monk has the trait "Need not bow for your Kiho," the player may
         target him, not bow him and still draw a card.''
         NEGATE #
         A word that indicates a prevention effect.
         NEGATE AN ACTION #
         To prevent all the action's effects, from the time the negation is applied. This does not
         negate targeting.
         NEXT #
         If the "next" period of time is referred to while one such period of time is in progress,
         this does not refer to the current period of time.
         Example 1: "After the next battle ends" does not refer to the end of the current battle.
         Example 2: "After the next time an action resolves" does not refer to the current
         action.
         A delayed effect that will resolve the "next time" something happens refers by default
         to the next time this turn.
         NON- #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 86/101
         A preÒx that means "not having that keyword or other game-relevant state"; for
         example, "non-Samurai" refers to anything without Samurai. An exception is
         "Nonhuman" which is its own keyword; "Human" is used to refer to its absence.
         NORMAL #
         A normal occurrence is one created by the rules rather than cards.
         Example: A normal Attack Phase is one that is created by the sequence of the game.
         ON #
         0.0.1. Effects "on" or "upon" cards refer to effects that inÓuence that card.
         See Effects and abilities "on" a card.
         0.0.2. Abilities, keywords and other card features "on" a card are those that
         come from its text, either printed or granted to it. This is similar to the
         feature being "from" a card.
         ONCE PER #
         See Restrictions on number of times.
         Ongoing: A type of effect that has a deÒnite duration.
         Open: A type of action that can be taken in the Action Phase.
         OPPOSED #
         A card, side, or army is opposed at a battleÒeld if there are one or more units in the
         enemy army.
         OPPOSING #
         "Opposing" refers to cards at the same battleÒeld, on different sides.

         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 87/101
         A player owns all cards that were originally in his or her play deck or that he or she
         brought into play from outside the game, including cards he or she created. Compare
         to Control.
         PAYING #
         For implications of the word "paying", as in "paying 2 less Gold", see Gold Cost.
         PENALTY #
         See Bonuses and penalties.
         PERMANENT #
         A permanent effect refers to an effect whose duration lasts until the end of the game.
         Permanent effects can still be negated, ended, and changed by other effects.
         PERSONALITY
         A Dynasty card type.
         PLAY #
         As a verb, "play" can refer to: putting into play a card type that normally enters play;
         using a Strategy card by putting it into the resolution area; bringing a Ring into play; or
         using an ability on a Ring that is out of play.
         PLAY DECK #
         See The Play Deck.
         PLAYER ABILITIES #
         Abilities that a player can take which come from the rules and not cards. See the
         indexed list of player abilities.
         PRESENCE #
         A player's having units at a battleÒeld, relevant to the Rule of Presence. . 38.
         PREVENTION #
         A prevention effect is one that uses language such as "negate," "cannot," "does not," or
         "will not". While a prevention effect lasts, it makes another effect or type of effect fail
         to happen whenever it would occur.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 88/101
         The various terms used to indicate prevention are interchangeable, and vary only
         according to grammar and readability.
         Example: An effect that "will not be negated" also causes "does not" and "cannot"
         prevention effects to fail.
         When an ongoing type of effect is prevented (for example, "Negate all Force bonuses
         on him"), this only suppresses existing effects for as long as the prevention lasts; it
         does not prevent new ones from applying. When an instant type of effect is prevented
         (for example, "Negate his destruction") this prevents new effects of that type for as
         long as the negation effect lasts.
         PRINTED #
         Refers to a stat, keyword, or other game text as printed on the most recent printing of
         the card, without modiÒcation. If the card is a created card, "printed" refers to the text
         it was created with.
         The printed value for a Province's strength comes from the Stronghold, before
         modiÒcation.
         PROCLAIM
         A way to gain Honor from Recruiting a Personality.
         PROVINCE STRENGTH
         A stat of a Stronghold, or of a Province.
         PROVINCE
         An area of the game that holds Dynasty cards.
         RANGED ATTACK #
         A Ranged Attack represents a military effect that destroys at a distance, such as
         archers' arrows or a magical Òery bolt. "Ranged X Attack", where X stands for a
         number, is shorthand for the text "Target a Follower or a Personality without
         Followers in the current enemy army. If its Force is equal to or less than X, destroy it."
         A Ranged Attack action is one with a Ranged Attack effect.
         If a Ranged Attack effect ends up being compared against a different stat than Force,
         compare that stat against the Ranged Attack's strength instead to determine whether
         the target is destroyed.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 89/101
         The targeting in a Ranged Attack is required as part of Good Faith to announce the
         action unless the Ranged Attack is optional or delayed.
         Melee Attacks follow the above rules but are not considered Ranged Attacks.
         Ranged Attacks can be combined.
         RECRUIT
         The action or procedure that usually brings Personalities and Holdings into play.
         REDUCTION #
         To "reduce" some number only refers to effects that work by directly changing the
         number of something.
         Examples of reduction: "All Honor gains this turn are reduced by 1;" "Reduce the Force
         bonus to 1;" "Set his Force to 3" (if his Force was over 3); "He copies the other Personality's
         Force" (if this lowered his own Force).
         Examples that are not reduction: Setting a maximum on a stat; changing the trait "Has
         +1F for each Oni in play" by destroying an Oni.
         Such effects are reduction, and not negation, even if they happen to reduce an Honor
         gain or loss to zero.
         REFILL #
         The process of putting a Dynasty card into a momentarily empty province.
         Instructions to "reÒll" a province, unless otherwise speciÒed, will reÒll it with a facedown card from the top of the Dynasty deck.
         An effect that tells a player to reÒll a province in a special way - for example, face-up
         and/or with a speciÒc card - will only affect the reÒlling of a province that is
         momentarily empty for other reasons. ReÒll effects by themselves do not discard
         cards or put them in already Òlled provinces.
         REFUSE #
         An effect that allows a player to avoid a duel his or her Personality was challenged to.
         As with duel stat changes, apply refusal conditions from the text that created the duel
         Òrst, followed by refusal conditions from other sources.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 90/101
         ''Example: A duel whose creating card says it "may be refused" is overridden by a
         challenger with the trait "Challenges from Itto may not be refused."''
         REHONOR
         To return a Personality to honorable status.
         REMAIN #
         A duration that lasts while something "remains" in a given state starts only if the thing
         is in that state at the time the duration begin, and ends whenever the thing is no
         longer in that state.
         Example: "Open: Bow your Personality. While he remains bowed, you gain 1 Honor before
         your turn ends." If the bowing is prevented, the effect does not happen, even if he bows
         later. If he straightens, the effect ends and does not resume if he bows. The effect also can
         last beyond the normal end-of-turn duration so long as he is bowed that whole time.
         Contrast this with an effect that applies while something "is" in a given state ("While he
         is bowed" in the above example). This effect has a normal duration and can turn on
         and off as the thing Óuctuates between states.
         REMOVE FROM THE GAME #
         When a card is removed from the game, set it aside. It exists outside all areas of the
         game.
         REPEATABLE #
         An ability with the Repeatable keyword may be used any number of times per turn.
         RESERVE #
         The following player abilities are relevant to the Reserve keyword:
         Absent Repeatable Battle, : If he would be opposed, Recruit your target Reserve
         Personality (into the current battleÒeld).
         Repeatable Battle, : If it would be opposed, Equip a Reserve attachment to your
         target Personality (at the current battleÒeld).
         RESILIENT #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 91/101
         The Resilient keyword means that, once per game per card, the card is not destroyed
         by the rulebook effects of battle resolution; that is, if its side loses or it ties. Its
         attached cards are still destroyed normally.
         A card that loses and then gains Resilient is still bound by the "once per game per
         card" restriction.
         RESOLUTION #
         0.0.1. The step of activating an action's effects.
         0.0.2. The step of determining the winner of a battle; Resolution Segment.
         0.0.3. The step of determining the winner of a duel. See Duels.
         RETURN HOME #
         To go home after a battle. See After Resolution.
         REVEAL #
         To turn a face-down card face-up.
         RING
         A Fate card type.
         SAME #
         For rules on when cards have the same keywords or Clan Alignments see here.
         SEARCH #
         To look through a deck or other area for a card of a speciÒed kind. After a player
         searches a deck, he or she must reshuÖe it after taking any card(s) searched for.
         If a card type is searched for (for example, "Search your deck for a Strategy") the
         player may only search the deck where that card type belongs (in the example, the
         Fate deck.)
         If multiple areas are searched, such as discard pile and deck, the player may choose
         the order unless an order is speciÒed (for example, "discard pile, then deck"). The
         player must declare whether he or she found any searched-for cards in one area
         before moving to the other, and cannot go back to a previously searched area. Once
         the desired number of cards is declared to be found, the search procedure stops and
         the player shuÖes any decks that were actually searched.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 92/101
         If the effect directs the player to do something with the searched-for card (for
         example, Equip or play it) and that effect fails, discard the card.
         A player may choose to have a search fail even if he or she is able to Ònd the card
         searched for.
         SENSEI
         A starting card type.
         SEPPUKU #
         An act of ritual suicide. If an effect directs a Personality to commit seppuku, apply the
         following effects: "Rehonor the Personality, then destroy him; these effects cannot be
         negated." (Unlike in previous editions, there is no rulebook ability allowing Seppuku.)
         SET #
         When a stat is set to a particular value, give it a bonus or penalty such that it reaches
         that value. See Setting stats for more details.
         SHOW #
         When an effect asks a player to show a card, he or she displays the face of a face-
         down card to all other players, then return it to its face-down state. In a two-player
         game, this is the same effect as looking at another player's card, but from the other
         player's perspective. However, this is not the same as revealing, which keeps the card
         face-up.
         In any game, a reference that depends on showing a card also includes "look" effects.
         SHUGENJA #
         A person trained in the magic of Rokugan. There are no special rules for Shugenja
         other than those applying to Spell cards and casting Spells.
         SIDE
         In a battle, an area that holds units Òghting together.
         "SOUL OF …" #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 93/101
         This is a keyword that includes another, older Personality's title. "Soul of" Personalities
         are equivalent to the older card for deck construction purposes. In a game, players
         may use the older card as a proxy for the "Soul of" version, but they must inform the
         other player of any differences in stats or wording between the two when it appears in
         the game.
         SOURCE #
         An effect's source is the instance of the procedure that produces it; that is, a single use
         of an ability, a single triggering of a trait or other triggered procedure, or a continuous
         trait.
         ''Example: Two Force bonuses that come from the ability "Battle: Give your two target
         Samurai +2F each" are from the same source, while two Force bonuses that come
         from separate uses of "Repeatable Battle: Bow your target Samurai to give another
         Samurai +2F" are not.''
         SPELL
         An attachment card type.
         STRAIGHTEN #
         To go from the See bowed to unbowed state for the straightening procedure in the
         game sequence, see Action Phase.
         STRATEGY
         A Fate card type.
         STRONGHOLD
         A starting card that determines a deck's identity.
         SUBSTITUTION #
         "X instead (of Y)" refers to the substitution of an old targeting, effect, choice, cost, or
         other game element (Y) with a new one (X). The following rules refer to any use of
         "instead" or "instead of."
         If the old Y is prevented or fails before the substitution is applied, the new X doesn't
         happen.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 94/101
         Example: A card says "you may bow a Personality instead of losing Honor," but you cannot
         use this to bow a Personality if an existing trait says that you do not gain or lose Honor.
         If the new X is prevented or fails, the old Y doesn't happen.
         Example: A card says "a target enemy unit adds Force to your army instead of the enemy
         army." If you have no army (i.e. no units) then the new adding Force fails, and your unit
         does not add Force to the enemy army.
         EXCEPTION: In effects that substitute targeting, if the new target has to be a "legal"
         target, then failure to Ònd a new legal target means the original targeting happens
         normally.
         Example: In "The action instead targets another of your legal Personalities with the same
         Clan Alignment," if you control no Personality with the same Clan Alignment who also
         satisÒes the targeting requirements of the original action, the original targeting happens
         normally.
         SWITCH #
         When an effect switches the locations of two units, each one simultaneously moves to
         the location of the other. If one movement is negated, the other one is also negated.
         TACTICIAN #
         All Tactician Personalities have the following ability, known as "Tactical Advantage".
         This ability is not printed on the Tactician and cannot be removed or copied from him
         or her.
         TACTICAL ADVANTAGE #
         Battle: Discard a card to give this Personality a Force bonus equal to the Focus Value
         of the discarded card.
         TARGET #
         To use a special process of choosing things to affect with an action or trait. See here
         for the targeting step in an action.

         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 95/101
         A Strategy with the Terrain keyword represents the ground on which a battle is
         fought. Most Terrains have a Battle ability that puts them into play at the current
         battleÒeld. After a battle ends, discard any Terrain at its battleÒeld.

         For usage of the term "this", see References.
         TIE #
         0.0.1. For a battle to end in a draw.
         0.0.2. For a duel to end in a draw.
         TIRELESS #
         An ability with the Tireless keyword may be used even if the card it is on is bowed.
         TITLE
         The name of a card.
         TO #
         In effects ("do X to do Y"), the word "to" indicates a contingency of one effect on
         another.
         TO A MINIMUM/MAXIMUM OF
         Phrase indicating an absolute cap on the amount a bonus or penalty can take a value
         to.
         TOKEN #
         A marker in the game, represented by beads, pieces of paper, or other distinct
         objects. Tokens may have a keyword, such as Corruption. They may also give a stat
         bonus or penalty, such as -1C, to whatever they are on. This bonus or penalty is
         considered to come from the last effect that placed the token on the card or area.
         Gold Production bonuses and tokens affect a Stronghold's Gold Production stat and
         have a special effect on Holdings whenever they produce Gold.23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 96/101
         Tokens may be placed on cards or Provinces, or "on" players (not literally), as directed
         by the text that created them. Adding, removing or transferring tokens is an
         instantaneous game state change.
         A token conveys its stat modiÒcations to any card or Province it is on, and these
         modiÒcations are considered bonuses and penalties. A token's "printed" stat bonus or
         penalty is the one it was created with.
         Tokens cannot exist on cards out of play. If a card or Province leaves play, all tokens
         on it are removed from the game. They do not come back if the card re-enters play.
         (Tokens are not cards, and created cards are not tokens.)
         TRAITS
         Text on a card creating or modifying effects outside of an action.
         TRANSFER #
         To move an attached card or token from one Personality or Province to another. The
         player does not need to pay the costs of a transferred card, but does need to meet
         any restrictions on attaching.
         TURN #
         A period of game time in which the active player takes the lead in playing actions and
         cards.
         When "turn" refers to part of a particular player's turn (for example, "the end of his
         Action Phase two turns from now") this means "two of the player's turns from now."
         References to "this turn" or "the turn" refer to the current turn.
         TWO-HANDED #
         A Personality, even a Kensai, cannot attach a Two-Handed Weapon if they have a
         Weapon attached, and cannot attach a Weapon if they have a Two-Handed Weapon
         attached.
         UNALIGNED #
         Refers to a Personality, player, or Stronghold without a Clan Alignment. "Unaligned" is
         not a keyword in its own right.
         UNBOWED #23.08.2017 Comprehensive Rules for L5R: Twenty Festivals - AEG Rules
         https://rules.alderac.com/cr_for_20f/ 97/101
         UNBOWED #
         Not in the bowed state.
         UNDEAD #
         "Undead" is a keyword with meaning in the setting. It does not mean "not dead" in
         terms of the game state.
         UNIQUE #
         A player will not bring into play or take control of a Unique card if he or she already
         controls a Unique card with the same title (but see Experienced for exceptions). If a
         player takes control of a unit with a copy of a Unique attachment he or she already
         controls, discard the new attachment.
         The Unique keyword also restricts deck construction.
         UNIT #
         A Personality, together with any cards attached to him or her, makes up a unit.
         If a unit or Personality changes location in play, all attached cards go with him or her.
         If a Personality leaves play (for example, by being destroyed), all cards in the unit leave
         play in the same way.
         Things that affect a unit affect all cards in the unit. However, things that target a unit
         target only its Personality.
         UNIT KEYWORDS #
         A unit has a keyword (Cavalry, Ninja) when the Personality and all Followers each have
         that keyword. EXCEPTION: An "Infantry unit" is one that does not have Cavalry; that is,
         at least one Personality or Follower in the unit is Infantry.
         Unit Force follows special rules.
         UNSTOPPABLE #
         The Unstoppable keyword on an action means that other players cannot take
         Interrupts to that action (but the action's own player can).
         UNTIL #
         The word "until" will not create an inÒnite repetition due to a limit having already been
         passed. It will simply fail in that case.
         For example, if an effect says "Give Mitsu +1F Fire tokens until he has exactly Òve" and
         he already has six, he cannot gain any Fire tokens from the effect.
         UPON #
         See On.
         WEAPON #
         A Personality can have only one Weapon Item attached. Exception: Kensai.
         WHEN #
         A point in triggered timing.
         WHILE #
         Indicates a condition that applies if something is true over a given period. "While he is
         dishonorable, he has +2F" means that for the duration of the effect he gets +2F at any
         time he is dishonorable. If he becomes honorable, and then dishonorable again,
         during this period he would get the +2F again.
         EXCEPTION: "While" together with "remains" has a different meaning; see "Remain."
         Example: "While he remains dishonorable" would indicate that he does not get the +2F if he
         is rehonored and then dishonored again.
         WILL NOT #
         This phrase in a card effect means that another effect is prevented.
         WIN #
         0.0.1. To win a battle.
         0.0.2. To win a duel.
         0.0.3. To win the game.
