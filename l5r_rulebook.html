      <h1>1: INTRODUCTION</h1>
      <p>Welcome to the combined Legend of the Five Rings (L5R) rulebook!  The goal of this page is to allow anyone to have what they need to play the L5R card game, regardless of edition they wish to play.</p>
      <p>In the Legend of the Five Rings (from here on: L5R) card game, you'll build a customized deck representing one of the various factions fighting for control and the future of Rokugan. You will conduct battles, duel, use politics, and subterfuge, and attempt to win the game with one of the game's victory conditions.</p>
      <h1>2: THE CARDS</h1>
      <p>There are fourteen card types in L5R, but not all card types exist in all arcs. Your cards also go into one of three areas - Pre-Game cards (which start the game in play), Dynasty cards (which start the game in your Dynasty Deck), and Fate cards (which start the game in your Fate Deck).</p>
      <h2>Pre-Game Cards</h2>
      <h3>Stronghold</h3>
      <p>Present in all arcs</p>

      <h3>Strategy</h3>
      <h1>3: GETTING SET UP</h1>
      <p>Each player has two decks: black-backed Dynasty cards and green-backed Fate cards, plus a special Stronghold card with two sides, one for going first (black border) and one for going second (white border). Which side is used depends on whether you go first or second, which we'll determine soon. For now, put either side face up.</p>
      <p>To get ready to play, find your Stronghold card and place it in front of you. The examples in this Rulebook will take the perspective of a Crab Clan player, but you can try to reach the same goals using your Clan deck.</p>
      <p>Next, separate the rest of your cards into Dynasty and Fate cards. Turn the decks face up and look at the Dynasty cards first. For the basic game, we'll be playing with only two kinds of Dynasty cards: Personalities (with your Clan insignia, or mon, in the upper left-hand side) and Holdings (with a three-circles insignia in the same place). If you're using an Ivory Edition starter deck, you may find other card types in there; remove them until you're ready to move on to the Advanced Rules.</p>
      <p>Do the same with your Fate deck, keeping only Strategies (red background), Followers (tan background), and Items (dark blue background). If you have a Dragon Clan deck, your Stronghold lets you start with one Ring in play; take it out of the deck and put it beside your Stronghold.</p>
      <p>Place your Dynasty deck below your Stronghold, about where your left hand is. Take the top four cards of your Dynasty deck and, without looking at them or turning them over, deal them out to the right of the deck. These four cards represent your Provinces—areas that hold Dynasty cards.</p>
      <p>Your Fate deck goes to the right of the fourth Province. The Fate deck provides cards that you draw into your hand of cards, representing secret resources and strategies. In your first couple of turns you won't need to use your Fate deck or cards. Just draw 5 Fate cards, facedown, and set them aside for now.</p>
      <p>Your opponent should take the same steps, setting up facing you on the table.</p>
      
<p>
Build Your Domain
The learning game will take you through
several achievement goals that introduce the elements of L5R. The first thing
to learn is how to produce Gold, building your game economy so you can buy
leaders and troops for war.
Your goal for this Achievement: be able
to produce 10 Gold.
Right now, the Crab Clan player can only
produce 4 Gold. The middle of the numbers on your Stronghold in the gold coin
shows the Stronghold's Gold Production: 4. Both players need to bring Holding cards into play to produce more Gold.-14-
Who Goes First?
Look at the bottom of the three numbers
on your Stronghold. That is your starting Family Honor, representing how
well-regarded your Clan is in court. The
player with the higher starting Honor
goes first. If you're playing solo, your
“opponent” will be a Lion Clan player
with 7 Honor (let's call him “Bob”). Normally, who goes first would be chosen
randomly in case of a tie, but even if you
also have 7 Honor we'll let Bob go first.
His first turns won't matter to your game,
anyway.
Because you are going second, turn your
Stronghold over to the white bordered
side with two Clan mons in the Title Bar,
one on the left, one on the right.-15-

Your Turn 1
For your first turn, we'll go through the
phases of the turn.
Action Phase
First comes the Action Phase. This starts
with you turning up all the face-down
Dynasty cards in your Provinces.
Stronghold
Personalities
Holdings-17-
Like the Crab Clan player, you will probably see a mixture of Holdings and Personalities. While the Personalities won't
help you toward your first Achievement,
the Holdings that produce Gold will. If
only there were some way to get rid of all
the Personalities and have another shot
at the Holdings?
Fortunately, there is a way to do this.
You have a number of abilities as a
player. The first action, Cycle, is one you
can only use during the Action Phase
of your first turn—right now. It lets you
replace cards you don't need.
Cycle
Limited: If it is your first turn, choose
one or more face-up cards in your-18-
Provinces. Put them on the bottom of
your deck in any order. (Refill the empty
Provinces face down.) Then, turn all
cards in your Provinces face up.
The boldface word “Limited” with a
colon (:) at the beginning of the text lets
you know that this is an ability, also
known as an action. Limited actions may
be taken in the Action Phase when it is
your turn. Actions are sometimes given
to players by the rules—like Cycle—and
sometimes appear on cards in play.
All abilities may only be used once
per turn. Once you have Cycled, you
may not use it again this turn.
Now, announce that you're taking the
Cycle action, and do what it says to do.-19-
Going from left to right, put each Personality on the bottom of your deck. Any time
a Province becomes empty, refill it immediately with the top card of the Dynasty
deck, face down. Then, turn the facedown cards face up. Hopefully this has
put more Holdings into your Provinces.
The Crab player sees two more Holdings
and a copy of the Personality, Ogre Bushi.
Stronghold
Personalities
After Cycling
Holdings-20-
With no more Limited actions you can
take, the Action Phase ends.
The next phase is the Dynasty Phase.
Now, you are going to use your Stronghold to bring Holdings into play.
Dynasty Phase
Right now, the cards face up in your
Provinces are not in play. You can't use
their abilities or any other text on them.
However, the Holdings let you produce
Gold. You need to bring these Holdings
into play.You have another player ability relevant to this phase: “Recruit.” It
lets you bring Holdings into play from
your Provinces. This ability has something new on it: a cost.-21-

(Holdings enter play bowed.)
After the word “Dynasty”—which
means a different kind of ability that can
only be taken in your Dynasty Phase—
there's a small gold coin icon with a star
in it, showing a Gold payment cost. The
star means that you choose how much
to pay, but the amount should at least
equal the Gold Cost number on the
Holding you're bringing into play.
The Gold Cost on Holdings is found in
the gold coin icon in the middle of the
*-23-
Bow to
Produce
Gold
card. But how do you produce Gold to
pay for them?
Bowing & Producing Gold
Fortunately, your Stronghold card produces Gold to get you started. To produce Gold with your Stronghold, bow
the Stronghold: turn the card 90 degrees
to the right.
4-24-
This gives you the amount of Gold
shown on the Stronghold's Gold Production coin (4 for the Crab player). This can
pay for your Recruit action provided the
Holding you are bringing in has a Gold
Cost less than your production.
The Crab player chooses the Iron Mine
and brings it into his play area, spending
2 out of the 4 Gold he produced. Holdings
always enter play in the bowed state.
He then refills the Iron Mine's Province
with the top card of the Dynasty deck,
face down.
After the Crab player has paid 2 Gold for
the Iron Mine, there is 2 Gold left over.
You can use leftover Gold to pay for
other cards in the same phase. At the
end of each phase, any unspent gold-25-
is grabbed by the Imperial tax collectors—it is not available to pay for cards
in future turns or phases.
The Crab player decides to Recruit the
second Iron Mine, and it enters play
bowed, refilling the Province as before.
(You can Recruit any number of times in
a turn, because the action is Repeatable.)
Now, can you use the Holdings' Gold
production right away? Not yet. The Gold
production of Holdings, like Strongholds,
comes at the cost of bowing the card.
The bowing cost icon ( ) means that, just
as with Strongholds, for the Iron Mine to
produce Gold, you have to bow it. You
cannot do this if the holding is already
bowed. So, you will have to wait until
it straightens (returns to the unbowed
state) to use the Iron Mine.-26-
The Gold Production of a Holding is found
in the coin icon in its top right corner;
when bowed, it produces that amount of
Gold. Text on the Holding may modify the
amount of Gold it produces (see p. 21).
When you have finished Recruiting, you
have the option to discard any face-up
cards in your Provinces. You should do
this, for example, if you see any Personalities who are too big and expensive to
be of use to you (say, costing 8 Gold or
more). The Crab player uses this option
to discard the Ogre Bushi card.
Discard
Repeatable Dynasty: Discard a faceup card from one of your Provinces.
(Refill it face down.)-27-
The Dynasty discard pile is located on
the left of the Dynasty deck. Cards go in
it face up and are out of play. As always,
you refill the Province face down as soon
as it becomes empty.
Then, end your Dynasty Phase. Just
before the Dynasty Phase ends, draw
a Fate card and add it to your hand.
Draw a
Fate Card
-28-
Although it's not yet time to look at your
Fate hand, you should add the top card
of your Fate deck to the cards in your
Fate hand anyway.
Congratulations! You have made it
through your first turn. It's customary in
L5R to tell the other player you are done
by saying “The table is yours.”
Our Crab Clan player has reached the
achievement of being able to produce 10
Gold! He had a lucky draw of two Iron
Mines, which each produce 3, added to
the Stronghold, which produces 4. More
likely, your deck will take another turn to
reach this achievement. If you see some
Holdings next turn, you should be able
to bring one or two of them out while
also looking toward the next achievement: bringing Personalities out.-29-
Your Turn 2
Just after the start of the turn, straighten
all your bowed cards. The Crab player
straightens his Stronghold and Holdings.
Again, reveal your face down cards in
Provinces at the start of your Dynasty
Cards vs. Rules
The cards in this game will sometimes
have text on them that seems to break
the rules. For example, the card “Famous
Bazaar” tells you to refill the Province you
Recruit it from with a face-up card, but the
rules say Provinces are refilled face down.
When the cards go against the rules,
follow the instructions on the cards,
not the rules.-30-
Phase. The Crab has Counting House
already showing, and now reveals two
Personalities and the Holding, Famous
Bazaar.
Building up your economy to gain the
first achievement may take a turn or two
longer. Once you have done this, it is
time to focus on a new goal.
Achievement 2
Build an Army with a Total Force Higher
than Your Opponent's Province Strength
The main way to win Legend of the Five
Rings is to destroy all your opponent's
Provinces by attacking them with your
Personalities. The next goal starts you
building an army and thinking about
the battle to come! As an example of a-31-

Personality, look at the face-up Hiruma
Moritoki in the Crab's Province. For the
next goal, the numbers to look at are:
c The Personality's Gold Cost (Moritoki costs 6 Gold);
c And his or her Force, the number
in the white area at the top left
of the card, representing military
power (Moritoki has 4 Force.)
Note
Games with a Crane or Phoenix Clan
player should use the Basic Honor
rules, on p. 63, with a different Achievement 2—Crane and Phoenix do better
seeking to defend and gain Honor than
seeking to attack.-33-
Now look at the topmost of the three
numbers on the Stronghold card (see
p. 15). This is the player's Province
Strength, representing the resistance
of his or her lands to attack. The Crab's
opponent is the Lion, with a Province
Strength of 7. So, to beat the opponent's
Province Strength and reach Achievement 2, the Crab will need to assemble
an 8 Force army. If you are playing solo,
take 8 Force as your goal, too.
You have nothing to do in your Action
Phase, so you move on to Dynasty. In
this phase, you should bring one of your
Personalities into play if you can, using
the Recruit action and paying his Gold
cost. Unlike Holdings, Personalities
enter play unbowed.-34-
The Crab player will Recruit Hiruma
Moritoki. He has a Gold Cost of 6, so
both Iron Mines bow to pay for him.
Next, he bows the Stronghold, which produces 4 Gold. This will Recruit Counting
House for 2 Gold, then Famous Bazaar
(it has special text that refills the Province
face-up, revealing Hida Saiyuki), for 2.

Dynasty Phase:
Recruiting-35-
The Crab draws his seventh Fate card,
and passes play to his opponent. With
Moritoki's 4 Force on the board, the
Crab is halfway to his goal of building an
8-Force army!
Your Turn 3
Now, straighten all your bowed cards
and reveal all the new cards in your
Provinces.
Assuming you have a Personality now
in play, your Fate hand becomes relevant. Both players should pick up their
Fate hand and look at the cards in it
(keeping them hidden from the other
player).
Let's take a look at the different types of
Fate cards available for play.-36-

These are oneshot cards you

Most of them are

Another kind,

now, is the Follower. It has a

upper left. Followers represent troops and
advisors under the command of a Personality. Unlike a Strategy, a Follower enters
play attached to a Personality, and so it is
known as an attachment.
A third kind,
the Item, has a
dark blue background and
the symbol.
Items are also
attachments, but
they add a Force
modifier directly
to the Personality, rather than
separately. Some
Items have the

word; Personalities can only have one
Weapon attached at any time.
Using Attachments
Two numbers on the Follower and Item-39-
The other is the Gold Cost number, in
the gold coin in the center. Like Personalities, attachments require Gold payment to enter play.
You bring attachments into play only
by attaching them to Personalities; they
cannot be in play without a Personality.
An attached card is placed partly under
the Personality, with space on the top to
show its Force number, and space on the
left to show whether it has any special
text or abilities.
In the game, a unit refers to a Personality plus all the cards attached to him—for
example, Hiruma Moritoki and any of his
Followers make up a unit. If a Personality is destroyed, all cards attached to him
are also destroyed; if something destroys
a unit, destroy all cards in it.-40-
The next player ability is called Equip,
and it will let you bring attachments into
play. Like the Dynasty action “Recruit,”
Equip asks you to make a Gold payment
as part of its costs, corresponding to the
Gold Cost number on the card you're
playing.
The Crab player sees two Followers in
his hand, each with 2 Force. Together
with Moritoki's 4 Force, these can help
him get to 8 Force total and meet the second achievement.
Equip
Repeatable Open, : Attach a target
attachment card, with Gold Cost equal
to the amount you paid, from your
hand to your target Personality.
*-41-
Equip is an Open action. Like a Limited action, an Open action can only be
taken during the Action Phase. Unlike
a Limited action, which can only be
taken during your own Action Phase,
you can take Open actions during any
player's Action Phase, yours and your
opponent's.
The Crab uses the Equip action to
attach the Young Battlecat follower from
his hand to Hiruma Moritoki. For this,
he pays 2 Gold, bowing his Counting
House to do so. He then bows one Iron
Mine for a 3 Gold payment to attach
Spearmen to Moritoki. Moritoki and
his Followers now total 8 Force—more
than the Lion's 7 Province Strength. The
Crab reaches the second achievement!-42-
Taking Actions
From Cards In Play
The Crab has no more Equipping to do.
However, player abilities like Equip and
Cycle are not the only source of actions.
You can also take actions from your
cards in play, following one extra rule:
You cannot take actions from bowed
cards.
If a card's text does not start with a boldface phrase such as “Open:” or “Tactical Battle:”, it is not an action. Some
actions have a bow cost ( ), meaning
you must bow the card in order to take
the action. Others have a Gold cost with
a number ( ), meaning you must pay
that much Gold.
2-43-
Action Sequencing
If both players can take actions in an
Action Phase, who goes first?
The player whose turn it is has the first
chance to take a Limited or Open action.
Then the other player can take an Open
action, then the player whose turn it is can
take another Limited or Open action, and
so on.
If you do not want to take an action, you
may pass. If one player passes but the
other plays an action, the first player can
again take another action, or pass again.
When both players pass one after the
other, the Action Phase is over. This procedure is known as an action round.-44-
Remember, like player abilities, you can
only take each action on each card once
per turn. Right now, the Crab player has
no abilities on cards that let him take
Open or Limited actions.
Keywords
A card's keywords, if any, appear in an
area below the art but above any other
text on the card (see below). Keywords
with a special effect from the rules that
you need to know are in boldface; keywords that don't have a special rule are
not boldfaced.-45-
While you are learning the game, if there
are any terms or keywords in card text
that haven't been explained to you so
far, just ignore them.
With no more actions to take, the Action
Phase ends.
Achievement 3
Destroy A Province
The most common way to win the L5R
card game is to destroy all your opponent's Provinces. With that in mind, for
our third and final achievement, your
Personalities must attack, win a battle,
and destroy a Province. (The Crane
and Phoenix Clan can consider this
achievement reached if they save their-46-
Province from being destroyed by an
attacking player.)
Attack Phase: Overview
On your turn, after the Action Phase
ends and before the Dynasty Phase
begins, you may declare an attack on
the other player. If you do, this will start
an Attack Phase.
In an attack, the player declaring it
is the Attacker and the other player
is the Defender; each player is the
leader of his or her own side. The
Attacker assigns any number of his or
her unbowed Personalities to a battlefield: an area associated with one of
the Defender's Provinces. The Defender
then assigns any number of his or her
unbowed Personalities to defend at-47-
the battlefield. Then, a battle will take
place at that battlefield.
One or more units at the same battlefield, controlled by the same player, form
an army. Cards in play that are not at a
battlefield are in their controller's home.

After taking Battle actions, the two
sides will compare their total Force;
the side with higher Force wins the
battle and destroys all cards in the losing army (if there is one). Also, if the
Attacker wins and has more Force than
the Defender's Force plus the Defender's Province Strength, the Province is
destroyed. In case of a tie, both armies
are destroyed. Destroy all four of your
opponent's Provinces and you win the
game!
Attack Phase:
Declare and Assign
The Crab player decides to declare an
attack this turn, after the Action Phase is
done, so an Attack Phase begins.-49-
He only has one Personality to assign—
Hiruma Moritoki, with his two Followers—and assigns him to attack the Lion's
Province next to the Dynasty deck.
The Lion player by now has brought
out three Personalities. He can assign
nobody to defend—but with 8 Force and
no opposing army, Moritoki's unit will
overcome the Province Strength of 7 and
destroy the Province.
Another option is to assign all three Lion
Personalities in play to defend against
Moritoki. This will give a strong defense,
but it's risky—battles are winner-takesall!
The Lion player chooses to send only
one low-cost Personality, Ikoma Shika,
to defend.-50-

Battle
The battle begins. At the end of the
battle, the total Force on each side
will be counted up. Right now, the
Lion army has 2 Force. The Crab army
has 4 (Moritoki) +2 +2 (the two Followers) = 8 Force. The margin of victory is 6 Force, which is not greater
than the Province Strength, so the
Province would not be destroyed. But
the Crab would win the battle, and
Ikoma Shika would be destroyed. The
Lion is hoping to sacrifice Shika to
save the Province.
In this battle, to keep things simple,
neither player sees the need to use any
Battle actions.-52-
First, the Lion player passes, and see
what the Crab does.
The Crab Clan player decides there's
nothing he wants to do to increase his
Force. He also passes.
Both players have passed, one after the
other, so the action round is over and the
battle is about to end.
Battle Resolution
Before the battle ends, both sides add
up the Force of the Personalities and
Followers in their army, not counting
bowed Personalities and Followers.
The side with the higher Force, in this
case the Crab army, wins. The Lion army
loses and suffers the consequences. As-53-
explained earlier, the Province stays
around, so the Crab has not yet met the
third achievement fully. He has won the
battle, but not destroyed the Province.
Then, destroy all the cards in the losing
army—Personalities and attachments.
Ikoma Shika is destroyed. If she had any
Followers, they would go to the Fate discard pile, which like the Dynasty discard
pile, is just “outside” its deck—to the
right of the Fate deck.
Before the battle ends, one last thing
happens. The attacking Personality is
still at the battlefield, so he (Moritoki)
returns to the Crab Clan home. After
an attacking unit returns home, all its
cards bow. If there were any defending units, they would also return home
after the battle, but without bowing.-54-
The Crab player's Attack Phase is now
over. In his Dynasty Phase, he bows
his Stronghold and the Iron Mine to
produce 7 Gold, which he uses to buy
Kaiu Gorobei and the Holding, Frontline Encampment. Finally, he draws a
Fate card and yields the table to the
Lion.
Opponent's Turn 3
The Lion Clan player, straightens his
cards and spends his Action Phase
attaching Followers. The Crab has no
Open actions, not even Equip.
The Lion declares an attack and assigns
both his units to the Province in which
Hida Saiyuki sits. The Crab assigns his
unit led by Kaiu Gorobei to defend;-55-
2F
Battlefield-56-
Moritoki's unit cannot assign to defend
because Moritoki is bowed.
The Lion army has 3 Force from Ichimoko, 4 Force from Sairei, 2 Force from
the Fearless Light Infantry, 2 Force
from the Kikage Zumi Initiates, and
1 Force from the Ashigaru Spearmen.
This adds up to 12, which is 9 more
than Gorobei's Force—the Lion needs
1 more force to take the Province.
The battle begins. If you are following with your deck, play out the attack
between you and your opponent. Or if
playing solo, imagine that the Lion Clan
player is attacking with the same units
and taking the same actions as the
player in the example. Can you beat the
Lion army?-57-
Actions on Strategies
Strategy cards are played from the
hand to take an action on them, and
then discarded into the Fate discard
pile. Actions on Strategy cards work the
same way as actions from cards in play.
Battle Actions
Battle actions follow these two rules, in
addition to the usual rules about taking
actions:
c You have to have at least one Personality at the battlefield to take
actions in that battle.
c You cannot take actions from a
Personality or attachment not at-58-
the current battlefield (Holdings or
Strongholds outside the Battlefield
are OK), and you cannot target
Personalities or attachments with
your actions if they are not at the
current battlefield.
The Defender has the first opportunity
to take a Battle action. The Crab player
chooses to use the action printed on
Kaiu Gorobei. This lets him discard
a Fate card from his hand to bow an
enemy card with equal or lower Force
than its Focus Value.
Focus Value is the number in the black
circle at the bottom of a Fate card (see p.
36). The Crab discards Back to the Front,
with its 3 Focus Value. The target is the 3
Force Ikoma Ichimoko, who bows. Lion
now leads by only 9-3.-59-
Now it is the Lion's turn. He shows the
Strategy card, Incapacitated, from his
hand and announces its Battle action.
This action has no cost (there is no Bow
or Gold icon in its text). The Lion targets a
defending Personality—Gorobei is the only
possible target. The action's effect then
moves Gorobei from the battlefield to the
Crab player's home. The Lion is not currently beating the Crab's Province Strength
of 9, with 9 Force on the battlefield.
The Crab player passes; he has no presence at the battlefield and no way to
play actions there otherwise. The Lion
player plays another Strategy from
his hand, Army Like a Tide, targeting
Ikoma Sairei to give him +1F and the
Conqueror keyword (see p. 29 of the
Advanced Rulebook).-60-
This provides the Lion player with 1
additional Force, enough to increase
his army's Force to 10 and threaten to
destroy the Province.
The Crab player, out of tricks for now,
passes. The Lion also passes and the
battle is over. Resolution now happens.
The Lion win 10-0 and destroy the Province. The card in the Province, Hida
Saiyuki, goes to the discard pile. The
Province's slot for Dynasty cards is not
refilled, but goes away. Move the cards
(or deck) on either side of the destroyed
Province together to show the shrinking
of the Defender's lands.
The Lion army now returns home.
Because he has the Conqueror keyword,-61-
thanks to the text of Army Like a Tide,
Sairei does not bow, and his Followers
do not either. Ichimoko and her Follower
both bow going home from battle. The
Attack Phase is over, and the Lion has
reached his third achievement, destroying a Crab Province!
The Crab is down by one Province—
but both his Personalities are itching to
strike back! We will leave the example
game here.

What Next?
If you're playing along with your own
decks, you can continue the game,
looking up unfamiliar terms and situations in the Advanced Rules as they
occur. Or, you can move along in the
Basic Rulebook to learn the Honor
and Dueling rules, and then learn the
Advanced Rules (included in Twenty
Festivals starters, or online at rules.l5r.
com). Remember, you end the game
and win when you destroy your opponent's last Province.
In the rest of the Basic Rulebook, you
will learn about Honor and dueling.-63-
Honor Rules
In Rokugan, as the proverb goes, “Honor
is a force more powerful than steel.” A lord
with an honorable reputation finds many
Adding Cards to Your Deck
As you collect more L5R cards from
booster packs, you can use them to
change your deck. As your L5R collection continues to grow, you will add and
remove cards from your deck, customizing
it to your playing preferences. You may
have no more than three copies of each
card (by title) and only one copy of each
card with the Unique keyword in your
deck. Both your Dynasty and Fate decks
must always have at least 40 cards each.-64-
political advantages in the society of the
Empire; a dishonorable leader finds doors
barred at every turn.
In setting up the game, you used the Starting Family Honor on each Stronghold only
to decide who went first in the game. With
L5R's Honor rules, your Family Honor is a
stat that can rise or fall during the game.
Each player should use pencil and paper,
dice, or some other method to keep track
of their own Family Honor, starting at the
value on the Stronghold. For example, the
Crab Clan player starts at 3 Honor.
Whenever a card, rule or action indicates that you gain Honor, increase your
current Family Honor by that amount.
Similarly, if a card, rule or action states
that you lose Honor, decrease your current Family Honor by that amount.-65-
Gaining Honor: Proclaim
Once during your own turn, after you
Recruit a Personality with your own
Clan Alignment, you may gain an
amount of Honor equal to the Personality's Personal Honor. This is known as
Proclaim.
Proclaim
Once during your own turn, after
you announce a Recruit action or an
action with Recruit as an effect, you
may choose to Proclaim the Personality being recruited. If he has your Clan
Alignment and is coming from your
Province, add his Personal Honor to
your Family Honor after he enters play.-66-
Example: The Crab Clan player
uses Proclaim on the Crab Clan
Personality Hiruma Moritoki,
paying 6 Gold as usual. Moritoki
enters play, and the Crab Clan
player gains 2 Honor corresponding to Moritoki's Personal Honor.
He crosses out “3” on his Honor
tally and writes down “5.”
Gaining Honor: Battles
You also gain Honor by destroying
enemy cards as a result of winning a battle. For each card you destroy this way,
you gain 2 Honor. In a tie, both players
gain Honor this way. You gain no Honor
for destroying Provinces.-67-
Example: A Crab army destroys a
defending Lion army consisting of
two Personalities, one with a Follower and one without. The Crab
player gains 6 Honor—2 for each
Personality and 2 for the Follower.
You do not gain any Honor for destroying cards with actions (for example, by
shooting them with a Ranged Attack.)
Honor Requirements & Losses
The Honor Requirement is the number
in the square banner to the left of each
Personality's Gold Cost (see p. 31).
If this banner has only a “-”, the Personality will enter play regardless of a
player's Family Honor.-68-
If this banner has a number, the player's
current Family Honor must be equal to
or greater than this Honor Requirement
number, or you cannot bring the Personality into play.
Losing & Winning By Honor
A player wins after beginning his or her
own turn with a Family Honor of 40 or
more, and loses after ending his or her own
turn with a Family Honor of -20 or less.-69-
Dueling Rules
A duel is a confrontation between two Personalities. The Crane and Dragon Clans
excel at dueling, and their decks contain a
number of cards that start duels. When a
card says that one Personality “challenges”
another, this starts a duel between the two,
who must be controlled by different players.
If the card says a challenged Personality
may refuse, his controller can now choose
to not enter a duel, and take the other consequences. Otherwise, the duel begins.
Chi
Personalities have the Chi stat, located at
the top right of the card (see p. 31). This-70-
represents their inner strength and power.
Chi is used in dueling and other effects.
Weapons have a Chi modifier that may
add directly to a Personality's Chi in the
same way that they add to Force.
Duels
Follow these steps in a duel:
1. The challenged player has the first
option to focus or strike. To focus,
you either choose a card from your
hand, or take the top card of your
Fate deck without looking at it,
and put it face down in a special
focused cards area in front of you.
If one player focused, the other
player then chooses to focus or
strike. The players continue to-71-
take turns focusing until one of
them chooses to strike. A player
who has focused four times may
not focus any more in that duel
and must strike. A player may look
at the cards he or she has already
focused at any time.
2. Once a strike has been called,
turn all focused cards face up. Any
traits on focused cards that say
“As a Focus Effect” happen. The
player whose turn it is chooses
the order. Ignore any other text on
focused cards.
3. The duel now resolves. Each
player totals the Focus Values of
his or her focused cards, and adds
his or her Personality's Chi to this
total. The higher total wins the-72-
duel, and the lower total loses.
Apply the consequences for the
loser and/or winner, as stated on
the card that created the duel. If
the two totals are equal, both players lose and take the loser's consequences. If the duel is a tie but
one of the Personalities is a Duelist and the other is not, the Duelist
Personality wins the duel instead.
4. Discard all focused cards.TM
